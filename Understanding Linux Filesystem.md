I'll start by looking at the filesystem, in Void Linux

- /usr/bin : The binary path (symlinks: /bin /sbin)
- /usr/lib : The library path (symlinks: /lib /lib64)
	- Includes Python in, because many programs depend on Python runtime; in `/usr/lib/python3`
	- Includes C/C++ Libraries in `/usr/lib/gcc/<arch-kernel-libc>`
	- The root folder includes the C shared libraries
	- Subfolders include package specific libraries, like Python, GCC, etc.
	- Some applications (especially in `/usr/local/lib`) put files in the root folder too
- /usr/lib32 : The multilib library path (symlinks: /lib32)
- /boot : The boot files - EFI and GRUB
- /dev : A ton of interfaces
	- ??
- /etc : Configurations
- /home : User home directory
- /proc : A ton of interfaces
	- ??
- /root : Root home directory
- /sys : A ton of interfaces
	- ??
- /run : A ton of runtime interfaces
	- ??
- Empty standard directories : /media /mnt /opt /srv
- /tmp : Temporary directory
- Other /usr Subdirectories:
	- /usr/include
	- /usr/libexec
	- /usr/local : The manual installations as opposed to package manager installations
		- Has `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/share`
	- /usr/share : Shared assets
		- Includes `fonts`, `applications`, `icons`, ...
	- /usr/src : Empty folder
- /var :
