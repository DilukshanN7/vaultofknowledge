- **Security** is about protecting **access** to your **belongings**.
- **Privacy** is about ensuring your **private data** remains **private**.
- **Anonymity** is about ensuring your **identity** remains **private**.

You can have "privacy and anonymity", "privacy without anonymity" or "anonymity without privacy", but all of them rely on security.
