### Frameworks
- PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive)
- GTD (Getting Things Done)
- Johnny Decimal

Johnny Decimal is an organization system, which is a simplification of the Dewey Decimal System, that goes like Category Slots (10) > Categories (10 Per Slot) > IDs (100 Per Category)

```
00-09 Index Category Slot
	01 Index Category 01
		01.01 Index ID 01.01
		...
	02 Index Category 02
	...
10-19 Category Slot 2
	11 Category 11
		11.01 Item ID 11.01
		...
	12 Category 12
	...
20-29 Category Slot 3
...
```

PARA is a messy organization system, that goes like Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives. Some people also like to put Projects inside Areas, making it go like Projects > Areas, Resources, Archives.

GTD is a task management system.
- In it, first you have to write down all your ideas.
	- All new ideas go in the inbox, which you review at a specific time of the day.
- Next, you have to see whether the ideas in the inbox are actionable or not.
	- If they are not, either trash it, or set it aside.
	- If they are, define the next physical action to move closer to its target
		- Next, see if the task can be completed in under two minutes.
			- If so, do it right away. (Why? Because tracking it will be more time consuming that the time to do it)
	- Next, see if there are multiple tasks required to complete a goal
		- If so, group them under a Project and move it to the **Project List**
	- If not, see if it's a task that is meant for you.
		- If not, delegate it.
			- Add these tasks to the **waiting for list**, and contact the person, and mark the current date on the item
	- If not, see if the task is urgent
		- If so, add it to the **next actions list**
	- If not, see if it is context-specific
		- If so, add it to the **context-specific list**
	-
