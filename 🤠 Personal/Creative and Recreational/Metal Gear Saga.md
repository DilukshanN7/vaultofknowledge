The philosophers were wealthy individuals of powerful nations who controlled them.
The Boss is a female legendary war hero from the US

A boy named John was recruited by The Boss, and together they developed a fighting style named CQC.
He was code named Naked Snake.
The Boss was sent on a double-agent mission to obtain the Philosophers' Legacy from the Russians.
EVA was another female spy from the Chinese Philosophers sent for the same mission.
Colonel Volgin was in possession of the Philosophers' Legacy, and he caused a nuclear explosion.
The nuclear explosion was made using an American missile, and triggered concerns of a war.
Snake was ordered to kill The Boss by the US to make her a scapegoat for the explosion.
The Boss told Snake that she had a vision of a world without borders shortly before they fought.
After killing The Boss, he got the title of Big Boss by Zero, a member of the American Philosophers.

So The Boss is the boss of Big Boss.
The Boss and Zero interpreted the will of The Boss in different ways, and they started to part ways.
Afraid that Big Boss would leave, Zero decided to covertly clone Big Boss to make the perfect soldier.
The project was called Les Infantes Terribles, and EVA was chosen as the surrogate mother.

Solid Snake and Liquid Snake are the first two clones of Big Boss.
Big Boss rejected both clones as he did not want this done, and he left the Patriots
