## Against "Human nature is egoism"
> To look at people in capitalist society and conclude that human nature is egoism, is like looking at people in a factory where pollution is destroying their lungs and saying that it is human nature to cough. -Andrew Collier, Marx: A Beginner's Guide
## Against "No incentive to innovate"

> [!NOTE]
> **Summary:** Innovative here means "different" more than "useful". And "different" is meant to be all about "artistic" nature of things, and "art", while is important, is not worth dying for. Because art and beauty flourishes through love, and there is no love in letting other people suffer for your benefit, and hence there is no art in it. And hence, there is no innovation, useful or artistic, either. In other words, the proponents of this argument skew the meaning of innovation to mean "different" rather than to mean either "useful" or "artistic".

> I'm aware that there are some things that are inherently beautiful to the human eye, such as some colour palettes, but it is not in favour of capitalism. Those are general principles of art, which are related to the properties of human perception of the universe, and it belongs to the realm of science, philosophy and art rather than to the free market. A price tag does not make something beautiful, the thing itself makes it beautiful. And not all beautiful things are intricate or demanding of extensive labour to justify capitalist ideas.

This is often used as an argument against "right to repair" and "capitalism". This plays on the feelings of an individual to the word "innovation" as something new and better, leading to "progress". "Innovative", "better" and "progress" are all good to have, which is why a person is encouraged to defend these ideas. However, this argument simply skews the true meaning of these words.

People will be interested in new technology that **actually** serves a purpose than a new phone with a different style of notch, aside from for artistic reasons.

Then it becomes more of an art piece than just a technology.

What capitalism encourages is forcing people to buy new art pieces because they are the "new technology", and "old technology" is outdated.

But see, the natural way of life always happens in cycles. for a simple understanding, no matter how strong of a food technology you invent, a human needs to intake a certain quantity of energy, and needs to digest it and get enough rest. Even if you turn people into cyborgs who can be recharged, you will need to spend enough time to recharge the being in proportion to the energy capacity of the individual. And even if faster charging technologies are 

The thing about art pieces is that, while they are good, and are very important to have because we all love wonderful things, they are not better than starving. And also, some people even find the aesthetic of a simple life to be wonderful, because all people are different (minimalism, plain-text interface lovers, naturalists, etc.).
