Folders are like boxes
Too many folders and it becomes harder to find data.
Too less folders and it becomes harder to find data.

This means folders must be created in proportion to the notes.

But then as the number of notes increase, the organizational structure of folders itself should change. Since folders represent categorization, and not just unnamed shelves.


A system that always does this upon addition of nw information could be define to be in a state of perfect sort. But for quick recall, we'll have to memorize the categorizations each time, and that is infeasible for a structure that's constantly changing.
