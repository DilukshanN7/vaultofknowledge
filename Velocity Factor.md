Velocity Factor (VF) is ratio of the speed of propagation of a wave or signal in an electromagnetic field to the speed of light.

In computer networking and cable industries, the terms "velocity of propagation" and "wave propagation speed" are used to mean the ratio of speeds, or VF, rather than the true velocity.

- For optical signals, the velocity factor is the reciprocal of the refractive index.
- For radio signals in vacuum, the velocity factor is 1.0
- For electric waves
	- In the most general case, VF = $\large{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}}}$ (= $\large{\dfrac{1}{\dfrac{\mu}{\mu_0}\dfrac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_r}}}$)
	- For most cases, VF = $\large{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa}}}$ (where there is no magnetic conducting materials)
