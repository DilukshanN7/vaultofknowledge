Velocity Factor (VF) is ratio of the speed of propagation of a wave or signal in an electromagnetic field to the speed of light.

In computer networking, the terms "velocity of propagation"

- For optical signals, the velocity factor is the reciprocal of the refractive index.
- For radio signals in vacuum, the velocity factor is 1.0
