Welcome!

This is the Vault of Knowledge, a public place where I take notes on things that I'm studying about. You call this a knowledge-base or to use the modern terminology, a second brain or digital garden.

The name for the website was inspired by a place of the same name in the game Sky: Children of The Light.

## How to explore
You can explore the notes using the search functionality or from the table of contents sidebar. A quick overview on the main categories:

- **Personal:** Where I keep notes on some stuff I'm personally interested in, because I'm lazy to keep them more private (although not much sensitive information will be there)
- **Public:** Notes on something that is cool for arbitrary reasons, but doesn't belong in any knowledge-base categories..
- **World Building:** Notes on Science, Engineering, Philosophy, etc. which can be used to make the world a better place.
	- Note that you may not see a conventional ordering of categories here. For example, I consider "computer science" to be a subcategory of "mathematics", "optics" to be under "electrodynamics" and "fluid mechanics" under "continuum mechanics".
- **World Exploration:** Not to improve the world per-se, but just exploring the world around us for the sake of it.
- **Unorganized:** Most notes I take are under the "General Notes" section here, because I can be too lazy to organize them.

## Other Notes
**NOTE:** The UI of the website isn't optimized for mobile phones, and even for websites. I built this page using a Obsidian-flavoured markdown vault to website generator named ObsidianHTML. I haven't taken the time to style out the website, but this is it for now. I went with that it is better to make something than avoid doing anything at all while waiting for perfection.
