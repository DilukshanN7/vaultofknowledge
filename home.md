Welcome to the Vault of Knowledge. This is the web view of my knowledgebase. I hope to turn this site into something useful which I can share with my friends, and everyone else as well. Most of the notes are in the **World Building/Science and Engineering** folder.

The title for this site was inspired by a location in the game Sky: Children of The Light with the same name.

This website was generated in HTML using [ObsidianHTML](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html).
The GitHub repository for this page is available at https://github.com/blacklightpy/vaultofknowledge

### Navigation
- There is directory view at the left side, to browse through the folders.
- There is a search button at the top for searching notes.
- There is a small graph view at the bottom, and a full page graph view button at the top. You can switch between 2D and 3D views to visualize the connections between notes. In the small graph view, left clicking a note opens the note, and right click just selects the note in graph view. In the full page graph view, it is the other way round.

> [!Previous intro]-
>Hi there! This method of taking notes is called a [[Zettelkasten]], or connected atomic notes. It is more commonly referred to as a second brain. The purpose of taking notes this way is to build a lifelong store of information.
>
>You can explore the notes using the graph, sidebar index (at the bottom for mobiles), search bar and links within pages.
>
>I wrote the notes myself in Obsidian, but I used [obsidian-zola](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola) for publishing the vault because I was too lazy to write my own publishing system. I couldn't upload it as it is because then the markdown formatting wouldn't get rendered. 
>
>So this site isn't perfect (as I want it to be).
>
>**Why did I publish this now, then?**
>- I wanted to publish this since February this year (2022), but I waited for writing my own publishing system, but I got busier with college work, and decided that it's better to do something rather than waiting to make it perfect and not doing anything.
> - Also having a public knowledgebase helps motivate me to maintain a better knowledgebase, and also help me share knowledge with others and hopefully do some cool projects together.
>    
>    I will write my own publishing system later to fix those problems. So consider this an early version of my site. There's also some personal information as well, but I don't mind it being there. I'll also be adding a blog and other cool stuff, as listed here: [[Personal Website Ideas]]
>    
>    **What's functional, and how to use:**
> - There is a search bar for quick access.
> - All notes are propely visible in my [[github.com/blacklightpy/Obsidian-Notes-backup|GitHub repo]]
> - Folders are at the bottom of the index. ğŸ‘‰ represents subfolders.
> - Subfolders three levels deep are not listed in the index. Those notes can be found in the graph and using the search bar.
>   
> **What doesn't work right:**
> - Folder heirarchy is not easily visible.
> - Not all folders are listed in the sidebar.
> - Readability is hard.
