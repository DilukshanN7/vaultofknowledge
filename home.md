Welcome!

This is the Vault of Knowledge, a public place where I take notes on things that I'm studying about. You call this a knowledge-base or to use the modern terminology, a second brain or digital garden.

The name for the website was inspired by a place of the same name in the game Sky: Children of The Light.

You can explore the notes using the search functionality or from the table of contents sidebar. A quick overview on the main categories:
- Personal: Where I keep notes on some stuff I'm personally interested in, because I'm lazy to keep them more private (although not much sensitive information will be there)
- Public: Notes on something that is cool for arbitrary reasons, but doesn't belong in any knowledge-base categories..
- World Building: Notes on Science, Engineering, Philosophy, etc. which can be used to make the world a better place.
- World Exploration: About exploring the world around us, separat
- Unorganized
