Hi there! This method of taking notes is called a Zettelkasten, a form of connected atomic notes. It is more commonly referred to as a second brain.

You can explore the notes using the graph, sidebar index (at the bottom for mobiles), search bar and links within pages.

I wrote the notes myself in Obsidian, but I used obsidian-zola for publishing the vault because I was too lazy to write my own publishing system. I couldn't publish it as it is because then the markdown formatting wouldn't get rendered. So this site has some issues. 

I will write my own publishing system later to fix those problems. So consider this an early version of my site. I'll also be adding a blog and other cool stuff (bringing back the Flash games era using HTML5), as listed here

**Why did I publish this now, then?**
- I wanted to publish this since February this year, but I waited for writing my own publishing system, but I got busier with college work, and decided that it's better to do something rather than waiting to make it perfect and not doing anything.
- Also having a public knowledgebase helps motivate me to maintain a better knowledgebase, and also help me share knowledge with others and hopefully do some cool projects together.

**What's functional, and how to use:**
- There is a search bar for quick access.
- All notes are propely visible in my [GitHub repo](github.com/blacklightpy/Obsidian-Notes-backup)
- Folders are at the bottom of the index. ðŸ‘‰ represents subfolders.
- Subfolders three levels deep are not listed in the index. Those notes can be found in the graph and using the search bar.

**What doesn't work right:**
- Folder heirarchy is not easily visible.
- Not all folders are listed in the sidebar.
- Readability is hard.
