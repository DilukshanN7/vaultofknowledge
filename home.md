Hi there! This method of taking notes is called a Zettelkasten, a form of connected atomic notes. It is more commonly referred to as a second brain. The idea is to constantly connect ideas to form a lifelong knowledgebase.

I wrote all the notes in Obsidian, but I used obsidian-zola for publishing the vault because I didn't get time to write my own parser. I couldn't publish as it as it is because then the markdown formatting wouldn't get rendered.

So currently this site has a number of issues:
- Folder heirarchy is not easily visible
- Not all folders are listed in the sidebar

**Why did I publish this now then?**

- I wanted to publish this since February this year, but I waited for writing my own publishing system, but I got busier with college work, and decided that it's better to do something rather than waiting to make it perfect and not doing anything.
- Also having a public knowledgebase helps motivate me to maintain a better knowledgebase, and also help me share knowledge with others and hopefully do some cool projects together.
