# Web3
- Web3 uses cryptocurrencies
- By means of DAOs, Web3 can let everyone hold power with capital
- But still network fees is being paid to the miners (or validators)
- Although anyone can mine (or stake), the ability of a person to mine depends on how much money they have. Miners need equipment, and 
- If a government was to distribute these fairly, then we wouldn't really need capital in the first place.

- There is also the concern about duplication - see [[sharin]]
