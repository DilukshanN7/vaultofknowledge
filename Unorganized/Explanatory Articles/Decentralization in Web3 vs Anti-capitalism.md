[[Web3]] is a modern trend on the internet based on the concept of [[blockchain]] since the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, and later on [[History of Ethereum|Ethereum]] in 2016. Just like the vision of blockchain projects, they focus a lot on decentralization. However, since they utilize currencies, the effects of capitalism still persist in these projects, and 
# Web3
## The effects of capitalism even in decentralization
- Web3 uses cryptocurrencies
- By means of [[Decentralized Autonomous Organizations|DAOs]], Web3 can let everyone hold power to an organization with capital
- Network services can run on the blockchain without paying a company, much like the "free and open source" software movement aims to do
- But still network fees is being paid to the miners (or validators)
- Although anyone can mine (or stake), the ability of a person to mine depends on how much money they have. Miners need equipment, and 
- If a government was to distribute these fairly, then we wouldn't really need capital in the first place.

- There is also the concern about duplication - see [[Sharing Resources]].
# Anti-capitalism
- Libre technois closely aimed with building a world free from the effects of capitalism
- Currency is okay in FOSS
- As of now, we choose to self-host programs instead of using some else's cloud services
- And also for social media, we choose federation, so that the user can choose which server to host on
- This is in line with trust, however, it also seems to divide people in a sense. I understand that it is about encouraging diversity - but at the same time, it takes away from the sense of oneness, by having to choose a server identity.
- It is also a bit messy for many people, like email, but see how all of us have converged to GMail. This is only partly corporate monopoly, but partly also because people got tired of complex IDs, or the inability to find a cool server name, etc. So they chose to place their cool usernames in their username.

- So it also deals with the problem about [[Sharing Resources]].
