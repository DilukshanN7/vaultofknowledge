One way I started having a doubt about it is by the nature of [[Cellular Automaton|cellular automata]].
# Cellular Automata Model
If we consider a cellular automaton, I am n that any configuration cannot arise from any other configuration, or that, all configurations will arise naturally from cellular automata, with the exception of [[Garden of Eden Patterns|Garden of Eden patterns]]

If I could know that for sure, one could say that a universe could either be "natural" or "created".

We would then also have to see if there is any advantage for either case of cellular automata to consider our universe as either "created" or "natural", when thinking with this framework.
