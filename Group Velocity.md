It is the velocity at which the envelope of a wave's amplitudes propagates through space.

The group velocity $v_g$ is defined as:

$\huge v_g = \frac{\partial{\omega}}{\partial{k}}$ where $\large \omega$ is the wave's angular frequency and $k$ is it's wavenumber.

The phase velocity is $\large v_p = \omega/k$.

If $\large \omega$ is directly proportional to $\large k$, then the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity. Otherwise they differ by the partial derivative slope.

# Relation to refractive index
Phase velocity: $\huge n = c/v_p = ck/\omega$
Group velocity: $\huge v_g= \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{c}{n + \omega \frac{}{}}$
