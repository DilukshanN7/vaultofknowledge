The CIELAB Colour space, also referred to as $L^*a^*b^*$ is a [[colour space]] defined by the [[International Commission on Illumination]].

It expresses colour as three values:
$L^*$ - Perceptual lightness
$a^*$ and $b^*$ - the four [[unique colours]] of human vision: red, green, blue and yellow.

CIELAB produces colours that are more perceptually linear than other colour spaces.
