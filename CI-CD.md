	- When master is broken - drop everything and fix it - keep a "no broken windows" policy
	- Run fast and fundamental tests first
	- Always use same environment
	- Build-in quality checking - style and security
	- Include PRs, but Peer Review each PR
	- CD - Auto Deploy PRs merged to master
	- Start with feature branches
	- In BDD, tests are a byproduct of thinking - boy scouts - always leave the code better
	- Deploy to staging for QA/manual testing
