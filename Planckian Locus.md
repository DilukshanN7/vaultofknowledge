Planckian locus or [Black Body](World%20Building/Science%20and%20Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Black%20Body.md) locus is the path or [Locus](World%20Building/Science%20and%20Engineering/Mathematics/Pure%20Mathematics/Locus.md) that the colour of an incandescent [Black Body](World%20Building/Science%20and%20Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Black%20Body.md) would take in a particular [Chromaticity](World%20Building/Creativity%20and%20Arts/Colour%20Theory/Colour%20Modelling/Chromaticity.md) space as the blackbody [Temperature](World%20Building/Science%20and%20Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Thermodynamics/Temperature.md) changes.

It goes from deep red at low temperatures through orange, yellowish white, white and finally bluish white at very high temperatures.
