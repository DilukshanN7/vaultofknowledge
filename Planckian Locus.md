Planckian locus or [[World Building/Science and Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Black Body]] locus is the path or [[World Building/Science and Engineering/Mathematics/Pure Mathematics/Locus]] that the colour of an incandescent [[World Building/Science and Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Black Body]] would take in a particular [[World Building/Creativity and Arts/Colour Theory/Colour Modelling/Chromaticity]] space as the blackbody [[World Building/Science and Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Thermodynamics/Temperature]] changes.

It goes from deep red at low temperatures through orange, yellowish white, white and finally bluish white at very high temperatures.
