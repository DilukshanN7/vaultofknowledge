Planckian locus or [[black body]] locus is the path or [[locus]] that the colour of an incandescent [[black body]] would take in a particular [[chromaticity]] space as the blackbody [[temperature]] changes.

It goes from deep red at low temperatures through orange, yellowish white, white and finally bluish white at very high temperatures.
