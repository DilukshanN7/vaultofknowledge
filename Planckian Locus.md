Planckian locus or [Black Body](Black%20Body.md) locus is the path or [Locus](locus.md) that the colour of an incandescent [Black Body](Black%20Body.md) would take in a particular [Chromaticity](Chromaticity.md) space as the blackbody [Temperature](Temperature.md) changes.

It goes from deep red at low temperatures through orange, yellowish white, white and finally bluish white at very high temperatures.
