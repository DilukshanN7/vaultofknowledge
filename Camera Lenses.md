Focal Length
Hyperfocal Distance
**Circle of Confusion (CoC)**
When the converging point of the image cone is in front of or behind the focus, the image formed on the screen is a circle, not a point. This circle is called the Circle of Confusion.
**Depth of Field (DOF)**
The distance between objects that create a focus range of acceptable circle of confusion is called depth of field.
