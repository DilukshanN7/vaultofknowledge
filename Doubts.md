- If light travels for long distances, will it's intensity be less than a quantum?
- Space is expanding - cosmic redshift - frequency decreases over distances. Does this have anything to do with it?

# Answer
Think of light flowing spherically from a source. The intensity of light is higher the closer you are to the source, for a given size of region. There is not discrete count, but instead the solid angle of the region of absorption with respect to the source determines the total energy.

That is to say, in my intuition, $E=nh\nu$ is incorrect, and instead it should be $E=\Omega h\nu$, where $\Omega$ is the [[solid angle]]. In natural units, we can omit the $h$ and say $E=\nu$ for the minimum energy of a packet. Considering the concept of solid angles, this means Energy is not
