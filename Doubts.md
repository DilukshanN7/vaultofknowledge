- If light travels for long distances, will it's intensity be less than a quantum?
- Space is expanding - cosmic redshift - frequency decreases over distances. Does this have anything to do with it?

# Answer
Think of light flowing spherically from a source. The intensity of light is higher the closer you are to the source, for a given size of region. There is not discrete count, but instead the solid angle of the region of absorption with respect to the source determines the total energy. That is, $E=nh\nu$ is wrong, and instead should be $E=h\nu$
