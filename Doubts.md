- If light travels for long distances, will it's intensity be less than a quantum?
- Space is expanding - cosmic redshift - frequency decreases over distances. Does this have anything to do with it?

# Answer
Think of light flowing spherically from a source. The intensity of light is higher the closer you are to the source, for a given size of region. There is not discrete count, but instead the solid angle of the region of absorption with respect to the source determines the total energy.

That is to say, in my intuition, $E=nh\nu$ is incorrect, and instead it should be $E=\Omega h\nu$, where $\Omega$ is the [[solid angle]]. In natural units, we can omit the $h$ and say $E=\nu$ for the minimum energy of a packet. Now of course, I'm going against the conventional explanation


Considering the concept of solid angles, this means energy is not defined for any arbitrary region, since the solid angle can be very small for a given region. Makes me wonder if $h$ is defined with a specific area in mind, perhaps it is the Planck area I guess.
