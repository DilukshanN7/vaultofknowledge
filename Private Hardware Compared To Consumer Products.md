We often say that technology has to be open source. What is the analogy of that compared to a consumer product?
# Conditions
- We require the design data of the hardware - on one hand for security, and on another, for societal progress
- We require the source code of the software - for security, 
# Arguments
- You can't access the internals of the computer
- You can't also access the internals of a bottle, but our purpose of drinking from it is served?
