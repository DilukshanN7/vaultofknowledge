Telegrapher's equations are a set of two coupled, linear equations that predict the voltage and current distributions on a linear electrical transmission line.

These equations are important because they allow transmission lines to be analyzed using circuit theory.

They result from, like all other equations, from [[Maxwell's Laws of Electromagnetism]].
# Transmission Line

It can be modeled as infinite capacitors and inductors along the direction of field propagation.
The impedance of the infinite path can be modeled as a resistance,

$\large Z = R = \sqrt{\dfrac{2L}{C}}$

So we can remove the capacitor and inductor chain and replace it with a resistor.
This is how the circuit will percieve the current
