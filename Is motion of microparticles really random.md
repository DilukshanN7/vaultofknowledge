In quantum field theory, electrons are described as fields.

Hence, it makes sense that (even without it) electrons can only be said to have a probability of being in a given region. For normal macroparticles, that probability is based on the center of mass of the object, or the proportion of the particle inside that space.

Why do we have to change this for electrons?
