A filter is an algorithm or a function block.

They are classified as follows:
## Based on construction
Active and Passive Filters

If the filter contains an active component like a transistor, then it is an active filter.
## Based on Frequency Response
- Low Pass Filter
- High Pass Filter
- Lead-Lag Filter
- Notch Filter

These four can be used to create other filters such as band-pass and band-reject filters.

## By Impulse Response
- [[Infinite Impulse Response Filters]]
- [[Finite Impulse Response Filters]]
