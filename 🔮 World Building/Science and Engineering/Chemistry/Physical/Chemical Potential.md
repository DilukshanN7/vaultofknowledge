Chemical Potential, or more specifically the Total Chemical Potential of a species is the total amount of energy that is absorbed or released during a change in the number of particles of that species (e.g. due to a reaction or phase change).

Chemical potential was first described by the American engineer, chemist and mathematical physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs. He defined it as follows: 

The total chemical potential can be divided into the internal and external chemical potentials.

In fields such as electrochemistry, semiconductor physics and solid state physics, the term chemical potential means just the internal chemical potential.

[[Electrochemical Potential]] is an example of total chemical potential.

In semiconductor physics, the chemical potential of a system of electrons at zero absolute temperature is known as the [[Fermi level]].
