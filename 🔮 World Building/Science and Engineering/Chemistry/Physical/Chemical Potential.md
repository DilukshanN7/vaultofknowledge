**Chemical potential**, or more specifically the **total chemical potential** of a species is the total amount of energy that is absorbed or released during a change in the number of particles of that species (e.g. due to a reaction or phase change).

It was first described by the American engineer, chemist and mathematical physicist **Josiah Willard Gibbs**.

Chemical potential is also referred to as **partial molar Gibbs energy** ($\text{E/mol}$).
# Formula
The chemical potential, ${\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {B}}}$, of a substance $\text{B}$ in an ideal mixture of liquids or an ideal solution is given by:

${\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {B} }=\mu _{\mathrm {B} }^{\ominus }+RT\chi_{\mathrm {B}}}$,

where $\chi$ is the chemical potential of a pure substance ${\displaystyle \mathrm {B} }$, and ${\displaystyle \chi_{\mathrm {B} }}$ is the mole fraction of the substance in the mixture.

This is generalised to include non-ideal behavior by writing:

${\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {B} }=\mu _{\mathrm {B} }^{\ominus }+RT\ln a_{\mathrm {B}}}$,

when ${\displaystyle a_{\mathrm {B} }}$ is the activity of the substance in the mixture,

${\displaystyle a_{\mathrm {B} }=\chi_{\mathrm {B} }\gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$,

where ${\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$ is the activity coefficient, which may itself depend on ${\displaystyle \chi_{\mathrm {B} }}$. As ${\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$ approaches 1, the substance behaves as if it were ideal. For instance, if γ B {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }} ≈ 1, then Raoult's law is accurate. For γ B {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }} > 1 and γ B {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }} < 1, substance B shows positive and negative deviation from Raoult's law, respectively. A positive deviation implies that substance B is more volatile. 
# Notes

The total chemical potential can be divided into the **internal and external chemical potentials**.

In fields such as electrochemistry, semiconductor physics and solid state physics, the term chemical potential means just the internal chemical potential.

[[Electrochemical Potential]] is an example of total chemical potential.

In semiconductor physics, the chemical potential of a system of electrons at zero absolute temperature is known as the [[Fermi level]].
