Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of each component of an ideal mixture of liquids is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component (liquid or solid) multiplied by its mole fraction in the mixture.

It also implies that the relative lowering of vapor pressure of a dilute solution of non-volatile solute is equal to the mole fraction of solute in the solution.
# Formula
${\displaystyle p_{i}=p_{i}^{\star }x_{i}}$,

where ${\displaystyle p_{i}}$ is the partial pressure of the component ${\displaystyle i}$ in the gaseous mixture above the solution, ${\displaystyle p_{i}^{\star }}$ is the equilibrium vapor pressure of the pure component ${\displaystyle i}$, and ${\displaystyle x_{i}}$ is the mole fraction of the component ${\displaystyle i}$ in the liquid or solid solution.

Combined with [[Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures]], this gives:

${\displaystyle p=p_{\text{A}}^{\star }x_{\text{A}}+p_{\text{B}}^{\star }x_{\text{B}}+\cdots}$

or

${\displaystyle p={\dfrac {p_{\text{A}}^{\star }n_{\text{A}}+p_{\text{B}}^{\star }n_{\text{B}}+\cdots }{n_{\text{A}}+n_{\text{B}}+\cdots }}}$ (vapour pressure of the solution is equal to the mole-weighted mean of individual vapour pressures of the pure components)
