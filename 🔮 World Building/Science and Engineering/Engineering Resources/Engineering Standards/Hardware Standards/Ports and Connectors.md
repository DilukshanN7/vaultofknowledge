Devices are connected together using ports and connectors to transfer information. Information can generally be transmitted in parallel and serial formats, or even in a hybrid of both.

Parallel interfaces transfer data through multiple channels simultaneously to send all information at once. Serial interfaces transfer all information through a single channel to the receiver. Due to design fundamentals and scalability, serial interfaces are generally the faster of both choices nowadays.
