	- Reciprocating Engine / Piston Engine
		- Gasoline Engine
		- Diesel Engine
		- Otto Cycle Engine
			- Rotary Engine (Rotary Crankcase)
			- Radial Engine
	- Rotary Engine / Wankel Engine
	- Air Breathing
		- Gas Turbine Engine
			- **Types**
				- Turboprop (Turbine Engine that drives a Propeller)
					- Efficient at low speeds and altitudes, best for regional airliners and cargo planes
					- Typically operate at below Mach 0.6
				- Turboshaft
- Electric Motors
## Reaction Engines
- Jet Engines
	- Air Breathing
		- Gas Turbine Engine
			- **Types**
				- Turbojet (Jet Engines that produce Thrust from the direct impulse of the Exhaust)
					- Capable of high speeds, making them suitable for supersonic and high-altitude flight
					- Typically operate at above Mach 0.8
				- Turbofan / Fan Jet
				- Prop Fan
		- Advanced Technology Engine
		- Ram Compression
			- **Types**
				- Ram Jet
					- Most efficient at speeds above Mach 2
					- **Types**
						- Air Turbo Ram Jet (Combines Turbojet and Ramjet)
						- Dual-Mode Ram Jet
				- Scram Jet / Supersonic Compression Ram Jets
					- They operate in the hypersonic range, above Mach 5
				- Shcram Jet / Shock Compression Ram Jets
		- Non-Continuous Compression
			- **Types**
				- Motor Jet
				- Pulse Jet
					- **Types**
					    - Valveless Pulse Jet
					    - Gluhareff Pressure Jet
				- Pulse Detonation Engine
	- Rocket Engines
		- **Types**
			- Nuclear Thermal Rocket
	- Hybrid Engines
		- **Types**
		    - Air-Augmented Rocket
			    - Pre-cooled Jets / Liquid Air Cycle Engine (LACE)
			- Air Turbo Rocket
				- Turborocket (Combines Turbo Jet and Rocket)
				- Air Turbo Ram Jet (Combines Turbo Jet and Ram Jet)
	- Pump Jet / Hydro Jet / Water Jet
		- Used for Marine Propulsion
		- The Pump Jet must be driven by a separate engine such as a Diesel or Gas Turbine
- Plasma Propulsion Engine
- Aerospike Engine
- Rotating Detonation Engine
# Considerations
- Understand Shock Waves to design efficient engines.
