# Types
- Air Breathing
	- Gas Turbine Engine
		- **Types**
			- Turboprop (Turbine Engine that drives a Propeller)
				- Efficient at low speeds and altitudes, best for regional airliners and cargo planes
				- Typically operate at below Mach 0.6
			- Turbojet (Jet Engines that produce Thrust from the direct impulse of the Exhaust)
				- Capable of high speeds, making them suitable for supersonic and high-altitude flight
				- Typically operate at above Mach 0.8
			- Turbofan / Fan Jet
			- Turboshaft
	- Jet Engine
		- **Types**
			- Turbofan / Fan Jet
- Ram
	- **Types**
		- Ram Jet
			- Most efficient at speeds above Mach 2
		- Scram Jet
			- They operate in the hypersonic range, above Mach 5
