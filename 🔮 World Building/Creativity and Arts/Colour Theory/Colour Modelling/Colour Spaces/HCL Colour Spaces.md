[[Hue]]-[[Colourfulness|Chroma]]-[[Lightness|Luminance]] (HCL) or LCh refers to cylindrical colour space models that are designed to accord with human perception of colour with three parameters. They seem to be synonymous with [[CIEHLC Cylindrical Colour Spaces|CIEHLC]].

The list of generally used synonyms would be LCh, LCH and HLC.

They are designed to have the characteristics of both the cylindrical translations of the [[RGB Colour Spaces|RGB Colour Space]], such as HSL and HSV, and the [[CIELAB]] colour space.
### Representations
- LCh / HLC - cylindrical representation of CIELAB
	- Synonyms: LCh, LCH, HLC
	- They are also represented as 


	- LCh(ab) is sometimes used to differentiate with $\text{L*C*h}_\text{uv}$
- HCL colour space - commonly used name for cyclindrical representation of CIELUV
	- $\text{CIELCH}\text{uv}$ / $\text{CIELCh}\text{uv}$ / CIELCh(uv) / $\text{CIEHLC}\text{uv}$
