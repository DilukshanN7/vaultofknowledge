By knowing the rate at which the height of the wave changes (dy/dt) and knowing the rate at which the wave propagates forward with respect to change in height (dy/dx), we can calculate the speed of the wave. This is known as the linear wave equation.

The equation is: $\dfrac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}} + \dfrac{\partial^{2} g}{\partial x^{2}} = \dfrac{1}{v^{2}} \left(\dfrac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial t^{2}} + \dfrac{\partial^{2} g}{\partial t^{2}}\right)$
