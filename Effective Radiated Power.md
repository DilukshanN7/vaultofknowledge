Effective Radiated Power (ERP) is the percieved power of anetnna along the direction of its gain. Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) is the same as ERP, except that the gain is measured relative to isotropic antennas (dBi), while ERP measures gain relative to half-wave dipole antennas (dBd).

India allows 4W ERP in 2.4GHz and in 868 GHz.

$EIRP(dB)=ERP(dB)+2.15$

Because $0 dBd = 2.15 dBi$

## Measurement of ERP
$ERP(dbW)=P_{TX}(dBW)-P_{loss}(dB)+G(dBi)-2.15$

$EIRP(dbW)=P_{TX}(dBW)-P_{loss}(dB)+G(dBi)$

Note: Antenna losses are included in the gain


## How to convert dBm to Watts
Use a dBm to Watts conversion table.
