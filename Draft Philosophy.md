Energy can be displaced from one place to another. Energy sources draw other energy sources towards itself. They can also repel other energy sources. The types of energies can be understood so intuitively. 

Motion in energy sources are percieved by other energy sources by means of light.

Not all levels of light can be observed and radiatied by energy sources. This allows energy sources to move without communicating with all other energy sources.
