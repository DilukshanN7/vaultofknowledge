- Star Trek Universe does not have currency.
- Yet when connecting with regions outside the federation, they still have to use an exchange currency called the Federation Unit with the external species.

Cryptocurrencies were meant to provide an alternative means of currency. The advantages of the platform were mainly:
| Advantages                                                                                                                                 | Satisfied                                                                                | Necessary |

| It provides an alternative to the banking system, where we have to rely on banks for the security of our digital storage and transactions. | Yes                                                                                      | Yes       |
| It provides a uniform currency for everyone                                                                                                | This is satisfied only within the scope of the communities we are already connected with | No          |


Power Usage:
Cryptocurrencies: 
PoW is the best solution I can think of so far.
Layer 1: Total power consumed by nodes + Power consumed by miners + Power consumed by transactions
Layer 2: Total power consumed by 2 nodes + Power consumed by transactions
Conversion: Current State: A mess / Can be: SIngle platform solution (like THORSwap)

Banks: 
Digital: Total power consumed by computers in a branch * Number of branches in a bank * Number of banks in a country * Number of countries + Total power consumed by transactions
Currency: Total power consumed by ATMs * ATMs per branch * Number of branches in a bank * Number of banks in a country * Number of countries
Conversion: Forex Platforms + Forex transcations in payment processors

Seems like a cryptocurrency based solution will be more energy efficient (without performing any calculations)
