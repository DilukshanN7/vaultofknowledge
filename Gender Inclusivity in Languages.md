The general argument by conservative people are that there is no grammatical or scientific basis to referring to more than two genders.

However, this is a terrible argument for judging people, because we formed languages and scientific models to help us understand the world around us. If they are not doing a good job at that, then we must improve our languages and models.


If you point at a non-binary person and ask them what they are to a conservative person, they will likely say that "he is a male" or "she is a female". But I can point at their physical or mental differences and ask them how can that be explained. They will then likely say that it is a flaw which has to be medically cured. But I must then ask, on what basis should one person's natural form be decided as faulty and has to be prescribed a cure?

It is only under the conservative faith that one can justify such a judgement. Because the lord has created Adam and Eve as the two distinct genders, just like any other genders.

It is not scientific that a child can only be raised properly with the care of a completely feminine mother and a completely masculine father. The so called results are only statistic, and they are only statistic because the majority of people are either dominantly feminine or dominantly masculine. Also, statistic models are not scientific models, they are only useful as guiding information for us to understand general trends. 

We cannot always follow general trends to make absolute decisions, in the same manner that we cannot say in a dorm full of people equally distributed from ages 7-80 that everyone should vote during the elections because the general trends show that the more people vote, the more representative of the public the government gets, regardless of the age. That's a very reasonable study, but it can't be extended to 7 year olds who are not familiar with the sides taken by political parties.
