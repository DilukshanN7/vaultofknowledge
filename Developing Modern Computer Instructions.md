- We must remember that we first designed tools without an abstract interface, even for something as simple as a water spray bottle. At first, we had to collect the water in a mug and pour water, but later, we developed spray cans, where it becomes easier for the user to simply press a button, and have the mechanical system output the right amount of spray. This isn't automated, as compared to a clockwork automaton, however, it paints the right picture.
- The computer looks at the command, and analyzes the "intent", "subject" and "parameters".
- Of course, this is not infallible, but through repeated trial and error, we can arrive at a standard way of parsing the intended instruction. Still, communication errors must not occur during critical events, so a standard means of communication can be established with a limited range of valid syntax.
