Colour spaces are generally 3-dimensional spaces that represent the [[Tristimulus]] spectral sensitvities.
The colours are specified by a set of three numbers (e.g. CIE coordinates X,Y and Z, or values such as [[hue]], [[colourfulness]] and [[Lightness]])

There are also color spaces that are not 3-D.

Even though they are mostly 3-D, they are represented using 2D [[Chromaticity]] Diagrams.
