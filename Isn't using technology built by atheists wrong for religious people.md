I wondered, many advancements in science and technology have come from scientists who were atheists. Not all, but a lot of them sure did. My question is, isn't it wrong for religious people to utilize their inventions?

Because, I was wondering if a modern technology could solve the problem of hunger, by directly harnessing energy instead of by food, thereby leading to world peace. Now, I figured out an objection to this would come from some religions, by stating that this advancement in technology has led them to being able to live in the world indefinitely, instead of reaching heaven like their religion describes. They would say this is a result of not following the word of god, because of which we are not entitled to heaven.

Of course, I'm keeping this aside from the fact that the world created in this manner could effectively be heaven itself, because some people could still think heaven is something better, because that's the nature of addictions, to seek a higher high.

So, if that is the case, shouldn't they have had not used any form of technology invented by heretics so they'd end up dependent on them? Because right now, people of faith lavishly use technology, while much of them were built by non-faithful engineers?
