Agile is a project management methodology involving a number of tools like [[Kanban]], [[Scrum]], [[Extreme Programming]], etc.

Agile originated from modern development practices such as [[Lean]]. It involves fast feedback loops and iterative development in contrast to the [[Waterfall]] method, where everything follows a pre-defined path from start to finish. 

Modern day software development is highly centered on agile methodologies. To implement a proper agile environment, it is necessary to understand the philosophy behind agile in addition to the systems.
