Agile is a project management methodology involving a number of tools like [Kanban](Kanban.md), [Scrum](Scrum.md), [Extreme Programming](Extreme%20Programming.md), etc.

Agile originated from modern development practices such as [Lean](../Lean.md). It involves fast feedback loops and iterative development in contrast to the [Waterfall](../Waterfall.md) method, where everything follows a pre-defined path from start to finish. 

Modern day software development is highly centered on agile methodologies. To implement a proper agile environment, it is necessary to understand the philosophy behind agile in addition to the systems.

# Philosophy
The agile manifesto describes 12 principles which form the philosophy of agile.

Some of them are:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan
