Smell is the sensation of fast moving particles.

This is why hot air is more conductive to smell, and cold air isn't so much.

Plants, for example have smell as a form of communication to attract pollinators.

Any stream of fast moving particles can be though of as increasing the internal energy of the system of those particles. High internal energy will lead to more sensation of smell.

But not all particles in rapid motion are understood by the human senses, just like how we cannot pickup all frequencies of sounds.


# Experiment to quantify smell
Assumption: Smell is the measure of "internal energy" of known particles, rather than the "amount" of particles.

Experiments to do:
- Try inhaling the same number of moles of a particle, but at different temperatures, and see if there is a difference in smell
- Try inhaling a lower number of moles of a particle and a higher number of moles of the same particle, but with the lower number of particles having a higher temperature

- Keep in mind that the particles have to be properly inhaled, and no significant particles should be lost in the experiment.
