Smell is the sensation of fast moving particles.

This is why hot air is more conductive to smell, and cold air isn't so much.

Plants, for example have smell as a form of communication to attract pollinators.

Any stream of fast moving particles can be though of as increasing the internal energy of the system of those particles. High internal energy will lead to more sensation of smell.

But not all particles in rapid motion are understood by the human senses, just like how we cannot pickup all frequencies of sounds.
