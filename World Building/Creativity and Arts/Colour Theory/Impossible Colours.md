They are colours that cannot be normally seen.

## Opponent Processes
The opponent colours in the [[opponent processes]] theory cannot be seen simultaneously.

## Imaginary Colours
[[Imaginary Colours]] are the colours that cannot be produced physically, but can be done so mathematically.

### How to see them
Be smart about your [[opponent processes]]. To see a green greener than normal greens, you will need to find a heavily saturated red and a heavily saturated green. Stare at the red for as long as you can, and then look at the green. The red receptors will be too fatigued to do their job and will be inhibited by the green colour. So the green receptors won't have anything to counterbalance them, so you will see a greener colour.

**Examples**
- Disney World used this effect in their design of the EPCOT Park, making pavements a particular shade of pink to tire out the red receptors so that the park's grasses look greener than usual.
