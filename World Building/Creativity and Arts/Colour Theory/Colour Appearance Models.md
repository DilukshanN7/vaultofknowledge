A Colour appearance model (CAM) is a mathematical model that seeks to describe the perceptual aspects of human colour vision, i.e. viewing conditions under which the appearance of a colour does not tally with the corresponding physical measurement of the stimulus source.

This is different from [[Colour Models]] which describe colours as tuples in a coordinate space.

# Phenomena to Capture
- Chromatic adaptation
	- It is the ability of humans to distinguish a [[White Point]] (or [[Colour Temperature]]) of an illuminating light source when observing a reflecting object. For example, a white paper looks white no matter whether the illumination is blueish or yellowish.
	- This is one of the most basic and most important aspect of all colour appearance phenomena
	- So a chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) that is used to model this behaviour is central to any CAM.
- Hue Appearance
- Contrast appearance
- Colourfulness appearance
- Brightness appearance
- Spatial Phenomena or Optical Illusions
	- They only affect certain areas of an image, and this has to do with the way the human brain interprets information contextually instead of as raw colours
	- They are hard to model because of their contextuality, and CAMs that try to do this are called image colour appearance models (iCAM).
