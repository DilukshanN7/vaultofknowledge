Newton knew that when sunlight is directed through a prism, it generates the colours on a rainbow.
To study this, he let a tiny bit of sunlight in a darkened room and dispersed it through a prism. After playing around by letting the individual colours through other prisms, he figured out that sunlight isn't white, but a combination of all the colours in a rainbow.

He observed when combining the red, green and blue colours, they would regenerate white light. He called these the primary colours. And mixing any two of them would create the secondary colours - blue and green forms cyan, blue and red forms magenta and 

He also noticed that red and violet were similar, so he twisted the band of colours to form a circle. This is known as Newton's Disc.

He also figured out that colours could be obtained by combining the primary colours:
Red and 

Primary Colours: Red, Green, Blue
Secondary Colours: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow
