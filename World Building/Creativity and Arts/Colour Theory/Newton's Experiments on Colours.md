Newton knew that when sunlight is directed through a prism, it generates the colours on a rainbow.
To study this, he let a tiny bit of sunlight in a darkened room and dispersed it through a prism. After playing around by letting the individual colours through other prisms, he figured out that sunlight isn't white, but a combination of all the colours in a rainbow.

He also noticed that red and violet were similar, so he twisted the band of colours to form a circle. This is known as Newton's Disc.
