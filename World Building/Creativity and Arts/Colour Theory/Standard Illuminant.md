A standard illuminant is a theoretical source of visible light with a [Spectral Power Distribution](../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Spectral%20Analysis/Spectral%20Power%20Distribution.md) that is published. They are useful for comparing images or colours recorded under different lighting.

[International Commission on Illumination](Colour%20Modelling/International%20Commission%20on%20Illumination.md) (CIE) is responsible for publishing all of the well known standard illuminants. They are represented by a letter or a letter number combination.

# Examples
- Illuminant A
- Illuminants B and C
- Illuminant series D
	- D50 (5000K) - Used in printing and arts industry
	- D65 (6500K) - CIE Standard for paper, ink, paint, textile, film and TV, displays and sRGB.
- Illuminant E
- Illuminant series F - represent various types of [flourescent](../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Chemistry/Physical/Flourescence.md) lighting.
