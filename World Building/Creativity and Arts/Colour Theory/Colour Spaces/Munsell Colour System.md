The Munsell Colour system consists of three independent properties of colour which can be represented [[Cylindrical Colour Space Models|cylindrically]] in three dimensions as an irregular [[Colour Solid|colour solid]]:

- hue - measured by degrees around horizontal circles
- chroma - measured radially outward from the neutral (gray) vertical areas
- value - mesured verticallyon the core cylinder from 0 (black) to 10 (white)

The drawback with Munsell colour system is that its colours are not specified by a set of equations, but a manually picked [[lookup tables|lookup table]]. This can be computationally expensive.
