Gamma Correction or Gamma is defined as the average slope of the function that relates the logarithm of pixels to the logarithm of exposure. It is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode [[luminance]] or [[tristimulus|tristimulus values]] in [[video]] or still image systems.

The relationship is called [[Tone Response Curve]].

In [[Cathode Ray Tube|CRT]] displays, the ratio betwen incoming light and output luminance was not linear. So this effect had to be modelled by considering a non-linear curve, which we call gamma. CRT monitors required a gamma of 2.5. To convert the gamma-corrected curve to a linear curve, we just had to apply the inverse gamma, that is 1/2.5.
