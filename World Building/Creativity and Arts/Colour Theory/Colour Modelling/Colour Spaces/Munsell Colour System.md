The Munsell Colour system consists of three independent properties of colour which can be represented [cylindrically](Cylindrical%20Colour%20Space%20Models.md) in three dimensions as an irregular [colour solid](../Colour%20Solid.md). The three properties are:

- [Hue](../../Colour%20Perception/Hue.md) (basic colour) - measured by degrees around horizontal circles
- [Chroma](../../Colour%20Perception/Chroma.md) (colour intensity) - measured radially outward from the neutral (gray) vertical areas
- value ([lightness](../../Physical%20Aspects%20of%20Colours/Luminance.md)) - mesured vertically on the core cylinder from 0 (black) to 10 (white)

It was designed to keep the three properties into [perceptually uniform](Uniform%20Colour%20Spaces.md) and independent dimensions, and was the first such model.

The drawback with Munsell colour system is that its colours are not specified by a set of equations, but a manually picked [lookup table](../../Working%20with%20Colours/3D%20LUTs.md). This can be computationally expensive.
