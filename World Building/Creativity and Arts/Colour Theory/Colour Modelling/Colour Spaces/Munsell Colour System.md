The Munsell Colour system consists of three independent properties of colour which can be represented [[Cylindrical Colour Space Models|cylindrically]] in three dimensions as an irregular [[Colour Solid|colour solid]]:


: [[Hue]] (basic colour), [[Colourfulness|chroma]] (colour intensity) and value ([[Luminscence|lightness]])



- [[Hue]] (basic colour) - measured by degrees around horizontal circles
- [[Chroma]] (colour intensity) - measured radially outward from the neutral (gray) vertical areas
- value ([[Luminlightness]]) - mesured vertically on the core cylinder from 0 (black) to 10 (white)

It was designed to keep the three properties into [[Uniform Colour Spaces|perceptually uniform]] and independent dimensions, and was the first such model.

The drawback with Munsell colour system is that its colours are not specified by a set of equations, but a manually picked [[3D LUTs|lookup table]]. This can be computationally expensive.
