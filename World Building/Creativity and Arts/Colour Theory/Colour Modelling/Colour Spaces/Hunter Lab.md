It is another colour space that is referred to as Lab, like [CIELAB](CIELAB.md) ($L^*a^*b^*$).
It was also derived from [CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space](CIE%201931%20XYZ%20Colour%20Space.md).

L is a correlate of lightness and is computed from the Y [Tristimulus](../Tristimulus.md) value using Priest's approximation to [Munsell](Munsell%20Colour%20System.md) value:
$L=100\sqrt{\frac{Y}{Y_n}}$, $Y_n$ is the Y tristimulus value of a specified white object.
a and b are termed [opponent colour](../Opponent%20Processes.md) axes.

[CIELAB](CIELAB.md) has almost entirely replaced Hunter Lab.
