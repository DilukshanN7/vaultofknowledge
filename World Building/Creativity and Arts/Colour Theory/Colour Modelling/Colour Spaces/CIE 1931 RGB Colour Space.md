This colour model tries to mimic the colours percieved by the human eye using RGB [[Tristimulus]] values. 

It was defined by two independent experiments in 1920 by W. David Wright with ten observers and John Guild with seven observers.

On the basis of these experiments, three colour matching functions were formed. These results were summarized and standardized as the CIE RGB colour matching functions $\bar{r}(\lambda)$, $\bar{g}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{b}(\lambda)$, obtained using three monochromatic primaries at standardized wavelengths of 700 nm (red), 546.1 nm (green) and 435.8 nm (blue). These colour matching functions define what is known as the  [[1931 CIE Standard Observer]].

The RGB [[Tristimulus]] values were computed using these colour matching functions.
