This colour model tries to mimic the colours percieved by the human eye using RGB [[Tristimulus]] values.

It was defined by two independent experiments in 1920 by W. David Wright with ten observers and John Guild with seven observers.

On the basis of these experiments, three colour matching functions were formed. These results were summarized and standardized as the CIE RGB colour matching functions $\bar{r}(\lambda)$, $\bar{g}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{b}(\lambda)$, obtained using three monochromatic primaries at standardized wavelengths of 700 nm (red), 546.1 nm (green) and 435.8 nm (blue).

Note that $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{b}(\lambda)$ are zero at 435.8 nm, $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ are zero at 546.1 nm and $\bar{g}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ are zero at 700 nm, since in these cases the test colour is one of the primaries.

The wavelengths 546.1nm and 435.8 nm were chosen because they are easily reproducible monochromatic lines of a mercury vapour discharge. The 700 nm wavelength, which in 1931 was difficult to produce, was chosen because the eye's perception of colour is rather unchanging at this wavelength, and therefore small errors in wavelength of this primary would have little effect on the results.
