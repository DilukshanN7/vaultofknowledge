In [[../../Colorimetry]], the CIE 1976 L*,u*,v* colour space, also known as CIELUV is a [[Colour Space]] defined by the [[../International Commission on Illumination]] in 1976, as a simple-to-compute transformation of the 1931 [[CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space|CIEXYZ]] colour space, but with attempted [[Uniform Colour Spaces|perceptual uniformity]].

It was based on the 1964 [[CIEUVW]] colour space.

Although additive mixtures of different coloured lights will fall on a line in CIELUV's uniform [[../Chromaticity]] diagram, called the CIE 1976 UCS, they will not fall on a line unless the mixtures are constant in [[../../Colour Perception/Lightness]].
