In [Colorimetry](../../Colorimetry.md), the CIE 1976 L*,u*,v* colour space, also known as CIELUV is a [Colour Space](Colour%20Space.md) defined by the [International Commission on Illumination](../International%20Commission%20on%20Illumination.md) in 1976, as a simple-to-compute transformation of the 1931 [CIEXYZ](CIE%201931%20XYZ%20Colour%20Space.md) colour space, but with attempted [perceptual uniformity](Uniform%20Colour%20Spaces.md).

It was based on the 1964 [CIEUVW](CIEUVW.md) colour space.

Although additive mixtures of different coloured lights will fall on a line in CIELUV's uniform [Chromaticity](../Chromaticity.md) diagram, called the CIE 1976 UCS, they will not fall on a line unless the mixtures are constant in [Lightness](../../Colour%20Perception/Lightness.md).
