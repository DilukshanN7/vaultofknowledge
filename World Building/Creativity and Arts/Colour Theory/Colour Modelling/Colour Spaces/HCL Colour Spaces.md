[Hue](Hue.md)-[Chroma](Colourfulness.md)-[Luminance](Lightness.md) (HCL) or LCh refers to cylindrical colour space models that are designed to accord with human perception of colour with three parameters. They seem to be synonymous with [CIEHLC](CIEHLC%20Cylindrical%20Colour%20Spaces.md).

They are designed to have the characteristics of both the cylindrical translations of the [RGB Colour Space](RGB%20Colour%20Spaces.md), such as HSL and HSV, and the [CIELAB](CIELAB.md) colour space.

### Representations
- LCh / HLC - cylindrical representation of CIELAB
- HCL colour space - commonly  used name for cyclindrical representation of CIELUV
- LCh(ab) is sometimes used to differentiate with $L^*C^*h(uv)$
