L, M and S are the types of cone cells in the human eye.
The [[spectral sensitivity]] of each cell is mapped to this color space.

It is mostly used is psychophysical research.

The retina adjusts the sensitivity of different cones when trying to white balance a scene and some digital imaging white balancing algorithms mimic these operations in LMS space.
