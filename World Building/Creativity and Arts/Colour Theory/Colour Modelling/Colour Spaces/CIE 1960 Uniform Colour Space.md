CIE 1960 Uniform Colour Spaces has been superceded by the [CIE 1976 UCS](CIE%201976%20Uniform%20Colour%20Spaces.md).

It does not define a luminance or [Lightness](../../Colour%20Perception/Lightness.md) component, but the Y [Tristimulus](../Tristimulus.md) value of the XYZ [Colour Space](Colour%20Space.md) or a lightness index similar to W* of the 1964 UCS ([CIEUVW](CIEUVW.md)) are sometimes used.

Today, the CIE 1960 UCS is mostly used to calculate [Correlated Colour Temperature](../../Physical%20Aspects%20of%20Colours/Correlated%20Colour%20Temperature.md), where the isothermal lines are perpendicular to the [Planckian Locus](../../../../../Planckian%20Locus.md).

# Motivation
- Judd determined that a more uniform colour space could be found by a simple projective transformation of the [CIEXYZ](CIE%201931%20XYZ%20Colour%20Space.md) tristimulus values.
