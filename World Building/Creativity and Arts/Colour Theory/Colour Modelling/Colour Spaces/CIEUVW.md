CIE 1964 (U*, V*, W*) [Colour Space](Colour%20Space.md), also known as CIEUVW is based on the [CIE 1960 Uniform Colour Space](CIE%201960%20Uniform%20Colour%20Space.md).

$U^*=13W^*(u-u_0)$
$V^*=13W*(v-v_0)$
Where ($u_0,v_0$) is the white point snd Y is the luminous [Tristimulus](../Tristimulus.md) value of the object.

The asterisks in the exponent indicates that the variable represents a more [perceptually uniform](Uniform%20Colour%20Spaces.md) colour space than its predecessor.

Wyszecki invented the UVW colour space in order to be able to calculate [colour differences](../Colour%20Difference.md) without having to hold the [luminance](../../Colour%20Perception/Lightness.md) constant.

He defined a [Lightness](../../Colour%20Perception/Lightness.md) index W* by simplifying the expressions suggested earlier by Ladd and Pinney. The chromaticity components U* and V* are defined such that the [White Point](../White%20Point.md) maps to the origin, as in [Adams chromatic valence colour spaces](Adams%20chromatic%20valence%20colour%20spaces.md)
