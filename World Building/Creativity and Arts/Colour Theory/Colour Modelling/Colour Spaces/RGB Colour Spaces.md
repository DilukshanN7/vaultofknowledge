They are any [[Additive Colour Models]] based on the [[RGB Colour Model]].

An RGB colour space is defined by [[Chromaticity]] coordinates of red, green and blue [[Primary Colours|additive primaries]], the [[White Point]] which is usually defined by a [[Standard Illuminant]] and the [[transfer function]] which is also known as the [[Tone Response Curve]] or [[Gamma]].
