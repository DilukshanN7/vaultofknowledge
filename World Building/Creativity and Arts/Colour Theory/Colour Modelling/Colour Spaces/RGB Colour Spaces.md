They are any [Additive Colour Models](../Colour%20Models/Additive%20Colour%20Models.md) based on the [RGB Colour Model](../Colour%20Models/RGB%20Colour%20Model.md).

An RGB colour space is defined by [Chromaticity](../Chromaticity.md) coordinates of red, green and blue [additive primaries](../Primary%20Colours.md), the [White Point](../White%20Point.md) which is usually defined by a [Standard Illuminant](../../Standard%20Illuminant.md) and the [Transfer Function](../../../../../Transfer%20Function.md) which is also known as the [Tone Response Curve](../../Working%20with%20Colours/Tone%20Response%20Curve.md) or [Gamma](../../Working%20with%20Colours/Gamma%20Correction.md).

The primary colours are often specified using their [xyY](CIE%20xyY%20Colour%20Space.md) chromaticity coordinates, although the u',v' coordinates from the [UCS](CIE%201976%20Uniform%20Colour%20Spaces.md) chromaticity diagram may also be used.
