It is a colour space derived from the [CIEXYZ](CIE%201931%20XYZ%20Colour%20Space.md) colour space as a cross between XYZ and its normalized coordinates x, y and z, such that the luminance Y is preserved. It is widely used to specify colours in practice.

In the conversion, the X and Z [Tristimulus](Tristimulus.md) values are coverted to [Chromaticity](Chromaticity.md) values x and y. The Y value is the lightness, which is indipendent of the hues.

This allows all colours to be represented as in 2-Dimensions using a chromaticity diagram, which is just the cross section of xyY space without considering the Y components.

Mathemtically, the colours of the chromaticity diagram occupies a region of the [Real Projective Plane](real%20projective%20plane.md).
