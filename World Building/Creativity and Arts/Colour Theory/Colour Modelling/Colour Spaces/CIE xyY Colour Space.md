It is a colour space derived from the [[CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space|CIEXYZ]] colour space. It is widely used to specify colours in practice.

In the conversion, the X and Z [[Tristimulus]] values are coverted to [[Chromaticity]] values x and y. The Y value is the lightness, which is indipendent of the hues.

This allows all colours to be represented as in 2-Dimensions using a chromaticity diagram, which is just the cross section of xyY space without considering the Y components.
