Luminosity functions or luminous efficiency functions are standard curves that measure the response of the human eye to light. Luminosity functions vary under different lighting conditions.

There are two luminous efficiency functions in common use.
They are [photopic](../Biological%20Aspects%20of%20Colours/Photopic%20Vision.md) (brightly lit) and [scotopic](../Biological%20Aspects%20of%20Colours/Scotopic%20Vision.md) (low-light).

## CIE Photopic Luminosity Function
Generally, luminosity function is used to mean the photopic luminosity function.
This is same as the [CIE Standard Observer](CIE%20Standard%20Observer.md)
Denoted as: $V(\lambda)$, $\bar{y}(\lambda)$

## CIE Scotopic Luminosity Function
The standard scotopic luminosity function was adopted by the CIE in 1951, based on the measurements by Wald and Crawford.
Denoted as: $V'(\lambda)$
