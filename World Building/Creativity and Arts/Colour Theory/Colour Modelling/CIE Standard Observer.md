Due to the distribution of cone cells in the eye, the tristimulus values depend on the observer's field of view. Standard (Colorimetric) Observer is a color mapping function designed to eliminate this variable, by representing a human's average chromatic response within a $2\degree$ arc inside the fovea.

CIE's colour matching functions $\bar{x}(\lambda),\bar{y}(\lambda),\bar{z}(\lambda)$ (for CIE XYZ standard observer) are the numerical description of the chromatic response of the observer. They can be thought of as the [[spectral sensitivity]] curves of three linear light detectors yielding the [[tristimulus]] values X, Y and Z. Collectively, these three funcitons describe the CIE standard observer.

For RGB color matching function, the respective R, G and B tristimulus values are used.
