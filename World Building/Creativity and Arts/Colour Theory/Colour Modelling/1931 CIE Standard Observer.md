Due to the distribution of cone cells in the eye, the tristimulus values depend on the observer's field of view. Standard (Colorimetric) Observer is a color mapping function designed to eliminate this variable, by representing a human's average chromatic response within a $2\degree$ arc inside the fovea.

It was defined 

Note that $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{b}(\lambda)$ are zero at 435.8 nm, $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ are zero at 546.1 nm and $\bar{g}(\lambda)$ and $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ are zero at 700 nm, since in these cases the test colour is one of the primaries.

The wavelengths 546.1nm and 435.8 nm were chosen because they are easily reproducible monochromatic lines of a mercury vapour discharge. The 700 nm wavelength, which in 1931 was difficult to produce, was chosen because the eye's perception of colour is rather unchanging at this wavelength, and therefore small errors in wavelength of this primary would have little effect on the results.

The cut offs at the short and long wavelengths were chosen somewhat arbitrarily. The human eye can actually see upto 810 nm, but with a sensitivity that is thousands of times less than that for green light.

This created a problem with the $2\degree$ colour mapping function that contributions of shorter blue wavelengths were underestimated. This led to the development of more perceptually linear [[Uniform Colour Spaces]]. There were also corrections by Judd (1951) and Vos (1978) without deviating from the original methodology.

CIE's colour matching functions $\bar{x}(\lambda),\bar{y}(\lambda),\bar{z}(\lambda)$ (for CIE XYZ standard observer) are the numerical description of the chromatic response of the observer. They can be thought of as the [[spectral sensitivity]] curves of three linear light detectors yielding the [[tristimulus]] values X, Y and Z. Collectively, these three funcitons describe the CIE standard observer.

For RGB color matching function, the respective R, G and B tristimulus values are used.
