Tristimulus is the term given to the perception of colour from three different sensors.

Tristimulus values are the resultant excitation of a sensor for a light of any given wavelength in relation to the other sensors.

Tristimulus value for each sensor is calculated as the weighted sum of the [[spectral power distribution]] of the colour multiplied by the [[spectral sensitivity]] of the sensor [[Wavelength-weighted Power]]
