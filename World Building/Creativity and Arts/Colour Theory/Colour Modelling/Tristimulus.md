Tristimulus is the term given to the perception of colour from three different sensors.

Tristimulus values are the resultant excitation of each sensor for a light of any given wavelength in relation to the other sensors.

Tristimulus value for each sensor is calculated as the sum of the product of [Spectral Power Distribution](../../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Spectral%20Analysis/Spectral%20Power%20Distribution.md) (SPD) of the colour with the colour matching functions or [Spectral Sensitivity](../Physical%20Aspects%20of%20Colours/Spectral%20Sensitivity.md) of the sensor for each wavelength. 

That is, **for example:**
Assuming an RGB system, if $S(\lambda)$ is the SPD function of a light source and $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ is the spectral sensitivity of the red sensor, the tristimulus value R of the sensor would be:

$R=\int_{\lambda}S(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda$, where normally $\lambda\in [380, 780]$

Generally the radiometric value used in the SPD is [spectral radiance](../../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Chemistry/Physical/Spectroscopy/Radiometry.md) for emitting sources, but for reflected light it can be SPD of [Reflectance](../../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Chemistry/Physical/Spectroscopy/Reflectance.md) or (transmittance) multiplied by the SPD of the illuminant factor.
