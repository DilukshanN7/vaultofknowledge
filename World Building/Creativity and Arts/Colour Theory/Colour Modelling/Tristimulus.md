Tristimulus is the term given to the perception of colour from three different sensors.

Tristimulus values are the resultant excitation of a sensor for a light of any given wavelength in relation to the other sensors.

It is calculated as the integral of the [[spectral power distribution]] of the [[spectral sensitivity]]
