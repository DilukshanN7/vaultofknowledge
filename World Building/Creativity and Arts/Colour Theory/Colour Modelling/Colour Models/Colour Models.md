A colour model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colours can be represented as tuples of numbers (triples in RGB, quadruples in CMYK).

A colour model without a mapping function to a [Colour Space](../Colour%20Spaces/Colour%20Space.md) is a more or less arbitrary colour system with no globally understood system of colour interpretation. Adding a mapping function between a colour model and a reference colour space establishes a definite footprint within the reference colour space, known as [Gamut](../Gamut.md).

**Examples:**
- CIE 1931 RGB
- HSL

Generally, [CIE 1931 Colour Spaces](../Colour%20Spaces/CIE%201931%20Colour%20Spaces.md) are used as reference models for specifying colour models.
