They are colours that don't exist physically.

For example, in [LMS Colour Space](LMS%20Colour%20Space.md), there are overlaps for wavelengths between L, M ans S cone cells. So some combinations like non-zero M values and zero L and S values are impossible.

e.g. If we could have a colour that excites only M cone cells, then we'd see a colour greener than most greens.

Also, in a normal trichromatic [additive colour space](Additive%20Colour%20Models.md) like [RGB Colour Spaces](RGB%20Colour%20Spaces.md), pure spectral colours would imply negative values for at least one of the three [primaries](Primary%20Colours.md).
