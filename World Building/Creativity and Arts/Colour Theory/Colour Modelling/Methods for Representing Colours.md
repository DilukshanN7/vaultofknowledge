- [Colour Models](Colour%20Models/Colour%20Models.md) define ways to represent colours as a combination of paramters.
- [Colour Spaces](Colour%20Spaces/Colour%20Space.md) are representation of colours as a combination of parameters. Colour Models are mapped to colour spaces to form a system that is easy to use.
- [Colour Appearance Models](Colour%20Appearance%20Models/Colour%20Appearance%20Models.md) (CAM) are advanced models that try to model the perceptual aspects of colour mapping.
- [Image Colour Appearance Models](Image%20Colour%20Appearance%20Models/Image%20Colour%20Appearance%20Models.md) (iCAM) are CAMs that also account for [Optical Illusions](../Optical%20Illusions.md) that are dependent on the images in context.
