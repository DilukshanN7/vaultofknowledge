- Normal colour perception is trichromatic, with L, M and S cone cells.
- There are tetrochromats - a small percentage of humans, almost always female
- Color blind people are Dichromats (Protan, Deuteran, Tritan)
	- opia is the lack of a cell, whereas anomaly refers to weakness in a cell.
	- It is also observed that there are 20 different types of L cells and 10 types of M cells, and anomaly is usually when the L cells are too similar to the M cells.
- Monochromats exist too
