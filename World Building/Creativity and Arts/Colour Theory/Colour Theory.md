# Properties
- Percieved Properties - Hue, Colourfulness (Saturation), Luminance
- Mixing - Additive / Subtractive - Primary and Secondary Colours
	- Metamerism
- [[Complementary colours]] produce a high level of contrast - this is used in art
- [[Impossible Colours]]

# Evolution
- [[Newton's Experiments on Colours.]]
	- He came up with the colour wheel aka colour circle in the form of a Newton Disc (Disappearing Colour Disc)
	- He gave the first method of mixing, which is to 1. mark two colours in a colour wheel, 2. find their barycenter, 3. The 
	- Criticized by: Robert Hooke, assistant of Robert Boyle
- Johan Wolfgang von Goethe, a German poet, proposed his set of [[complementary colours]].
- Thomas Young's  [[Trichromatic Theory of Colours]]. It distinguished additive and subtractive colours. He came up with a [[colour triangle]] (also used in CIE 1931 Colour Space)
- Hermann von Helmholtz developed Young's theory by classifying the photoreceptor cells.
- Helmholtz's influence of unconscious inferences.
- James Clark Maxwell's Mathematical description of Young-Helmhotz Trichromatic theory using linear algebra.
- Ewald Hering's [[Opponent Processes]] was in dispute with the theory by Young, Helmholtz and Maxwell
- Later, Johannes von Kries published the zone thoery in 1905 that synthesizes both descriptions as one, where Young-Helmholtz theory describes the interaction of light with the receptors and Hering the image processing stage.
- In 1925, Erwin Schrodinger published a paper inspired by von Kries, titled 'On the relation of the four color to the three color theory' where he probes for a formal relationship between the two theories.
- The conundrum was solved by the discovery of color-opponent gangelion cells in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. We know know the human eye possesses three types of color-sensitive receptors which then combine their signals in three color-opponent channels as proposed by Hering. Thus both theories are correct.
