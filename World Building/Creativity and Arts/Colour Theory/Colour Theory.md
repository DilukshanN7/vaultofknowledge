# Evolution
- [[Newton's Experiments on Colours]]
	- Criticized by: Robert Hooke, assistant of Robert Boyle
- Johan Wolfgang von Goethe, a German poet, proposed his set of primary colours.
- Thomas Young's and Hermann von Helmholtz's [[Trichromatic Theory of Colours]]
- James Clark Maxwell's Mathematical description of Young-Helmhotz Trichromatic theory
- Ewald Hering's [[Opponent Processes]] was in dispute with the theory by Young, Helmholtz and Maxwell
- Later, Johannes von Kries published the zone thoery in 1905 that synthesizes both descriptions as one, where Young-Helmholtz theory describes the interaction of light with the receptors and Hering the image processing stage.
- In 1925, Erwin Schrodinger published a paper inspired by von Kries, titled 'On the relation of the four color to the three color theory' where he probes for a formal relationship between the two theories.
- The conundrum was solved by the discovery of color-opponent gangelion cells in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. We know know the human eye possesses three types of color-sensitive receptors which then combine their signals in three color-opponent channels as proposed by Hering. Thus both theories are correct.
