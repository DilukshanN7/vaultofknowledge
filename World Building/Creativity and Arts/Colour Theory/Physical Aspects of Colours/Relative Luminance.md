Relative luminance ($Y$) follows the [[../../../Science and Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Spectral Analysis/Photometry|photometric]] defintion of [[Luminance]] $L$ including spectral weighting for human vision, but while luminance $L$ is a measure of light in units such as $cd/m^2$, relative luminance $Y$ values are normalized as 0.0 to 1.0 (or 1 to 100, with 1.0 being a theoretical perfect reflector of 100% [[../Colour Modelling/White Point|reference white]].

The use of relative values is useful in [[../Colour Modelling/Colour Appearance Models/Colour Appearance Models]] that describe perception relative to the eye's adaptiation state and a reference white.

For CIE [[../Colour Modelling/Colour Spaces/Colour Space|colour spaces]] [[../Colour Modelling/Colour Spaces/CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space|XYZ]] and [[../Colour Modelling/Colour Spaces/CIE xyY Colour Space|xyY]], the letter $Y$ refers to relative luminance.
