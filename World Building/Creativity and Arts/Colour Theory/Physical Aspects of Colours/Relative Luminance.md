Relative luminance ($Y$) follows the [photometric](Photometry.md) defintion of [Luminance](Luminance.md) $L$ including spectral weighting for human vision, but while luminance $L$ is a measure of light in units such as $cd/m^2$, relative luminance $Y$ values are normalized as 0.0 to 1.0 (or 1 to 100, with 1.0 being a theoretical perfect reflector of 100% [reference white](White%20Point.md).

The use of relative values is useful in [Colour Appearance Models](colour%20appearance%20models.md) that describe perception relative to the eye's adaptiation state and a reference white.

For CIE [colour spaces](Colour%20Space.md) [XYZ](CIE%201931%20XYZ%20Colour%20Space.md) and [xyY](CIE%20xyY%20Colour%20Space.md), the letter $Y$ refers to relative luminance.
