It is the relative efficiency of detection of light or any signal as a function of the frequency or wavelength of that signal.

Often represented as [Quantum Efficiency](../../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Spectral%20Analysis/Quantum%20Efficiency.md) or [Spectral Responsivity](Spectral%20Responsivity.md).
