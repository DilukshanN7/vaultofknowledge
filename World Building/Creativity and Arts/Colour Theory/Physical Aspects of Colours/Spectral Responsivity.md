It measures the [Gain](../../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Mathematics/Applied%20Mathematics/Digital%20Signal%20Processing/Gain.md) of a photodetector system.

$R=\eta \frac{q}{hf}$ 
$\eta$ is the [Quantum Efficiency](../../../Science%20and%20Engineering/Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Spectral%20Analysis/Quantum%20Efficiency.md) of a photodiode at a wavelength.
