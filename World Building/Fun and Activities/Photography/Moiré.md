Moire Effect is the effect you get when you overlap two meshes together with a slight displacement. (? verify)

## In art and maths
In mathematics, physics, and art, moiré patterns or moiré fringes are large-scale interference patterns that can be produced when an opaque ruled pattern with transparent gaps is overlaid on another similar pattern.

- Film cameras don't have this problem because they don't have pixel grids
- Some cameras try to avoid moire by not having grid-layout pixels
