- Internals of a resistor
- How a NAND Flash is engineered practically -
Q:
NAND FLASH is slower than flip flops

NAND FLASH and flip-flops are made of NAND Gates
Both NAND Flash and flip flops operate at 5V

The difference is that NAND FLASH uses floating gate transistors to store charge
NAND Gates are made of transistors

Flash drive is made up of NAND FLASH and Cache memory
Cache memory is made of flip-flops and has speeds equivalent to a CPU

In other words, what makes Cache memory faster than Flash drives?

A:
NAND Gates are logical circuits
Gate contact of a MOS transistor is different from it.

NAND gates don't make the internal circuits of a flip-flop in practice.
Flip-flops are simplified to save space.
Ex: SRAM cell made from CMOS pass transistor logic

The reason why flash memory is slower is because it has a large amount of charge to be put through an isolator (SiO2, so the drift velocity is much slower) onto the floating gate. This makes time.

Transistors which have a normal gate contact can have that one fully charged and de-charged within picoseconds.
