Many-Task Computing (MTC) tries to bridge the gap between [High-Performance Computing](High-Performance%20Computing.md) and [High-Throughput Computing](High-Throughput%20Computing.md).

MTC is like HTC, but it has its speed measured in seconds (e.g. FLOPS, tasks/s, MB/s I/O rates)

It is used for high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled by file system operations.
