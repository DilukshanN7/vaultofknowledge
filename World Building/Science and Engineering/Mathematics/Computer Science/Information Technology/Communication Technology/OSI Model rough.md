- Packets (Smallest data unit (PDU) in the Network Layer)
- Fragments (If packets are larger than MTU, and if DF is not set, the packet is fragmented by the Network Layer)
- Frames (Smallest data unit (PDU) in the Data Link Layer | Are just like packets)
- Datagram (Data unit of transfer in networking | Used in the transport layer)
- Segments (Smallest data unit (PDU) in the Transport Layer| They are broken packets with checksum added in them)
