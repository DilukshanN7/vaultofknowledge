# What is DevOps?
DevOps stands for Development and Operations, which refers to the combination of software development and IT operations. This originated from the practice of [[Agile]] methodologies in development teams and allows for faster development, eliminating areas of fricition.

# Characteristics
- Agile workflow
	- Simplicity and Automation are key to a strong development team
- Use of [[Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment|CI/CD systems]] for fast feedback loops
- Monitoring
	- Use of product-wide logging and metrics for improvement of operations
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
	- Use of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) [[Infrastructure as a Service Platforms|Platforms]] and configuration files
- Microservices
- Policy as Code (PaC)
- Monitoring

# Steps in DevOps
- During development, follow [[Software Development Practices]]
- Implement CI/CD
	- Originates from [[Extreme Programming|XP]]
	- Work in small batches and units. Not the fastest for large features, but it ensures testing well.

# Tips
- Transition to [[Microservices]] when it gives more performance than monoliths
- Get acquainted with Domain-Driven Development, TDD and BDD
- Reorganize the teams to be cross-functional, removing silos and flattening heirarchies to allow for innovation.
- Foster a DevOps work culture, where lines between developer and operation jobs are blurred.
- Testers should work with Devs
- Testers are not replaceable, they know how users work
- Testers should constantly explore and learn new skills.
