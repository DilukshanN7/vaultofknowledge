# Tips for CI-CD
- When master is broken - drop everything and fix it - keep a "no broken windows" policy
- Run fast and fundamental tests first
- Always use same environment
- Build-in quality checking - style and security
- Include PRs, but Peer Review each PR
- CD - Auto Deploy PRs merged to master
- Start with feature branches
- In BDD, tests are a byproduct of thinking - boy scouts - always leave the code better
- Deploy to staging for QA/manual testing
