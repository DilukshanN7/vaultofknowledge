# Terms
- Frameworks
- Networks - Models and Networks are often used interchangeably. But mainly the difference is that algorithms are implemented on networks to create models.
- [AI Algorithms](AI%20Algorithms.md)
- Models - Products of AI Training, by running a machine learning algorithm on training data
- Inference - Inference is where deep learning capabilities learned during training are put to work
