YAML Ain't Markup Language is a data-serialization language, much like [JSON](JavaScript%20Object%20Notation.md), but is focused on being human readable at the same time.

YAML is also a superset of JSON, meaning it can parse JSON objects within it.

Generally we say JSON is better for data transfers and YAML is better for configuration files.
