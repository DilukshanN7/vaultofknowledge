[[Field Programmable Gate Arrays]] (FPGA) are processing units whose function can be modified by the programmer.

An FPGA consists of programmable logic blocks (PLB) such as LUTs, MUX, DSP and RAM and programmable interconnect points (PIP).
These components can be thought of as lego blocks with which the functionality of the FPGA can be changed.
## FPGA Fabric
This refers to the plain hardware of the FPGA, composed of PLBs and PIPs.
## FPGA Core
This can mean either:
- FPGA RTL code designed for a purpose
- Or in case of FPGA based SoCs
