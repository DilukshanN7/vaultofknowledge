[[Field Programmable Gate Arrays]] (FPGA) are processing units whose function can be modified by the programmer.

An FPGA consists of programmable logic blocks (PLB) such as LUTs, MUX, DSP and RAM.
These components can be thought of as lego blocks with which the functionality of the FPGA can be changed.
