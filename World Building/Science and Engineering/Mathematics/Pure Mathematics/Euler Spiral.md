Also known as clothoids, spiros or Cornu spirals
They are curves whose curvature changes linearly with curve length (curvature of
a circular circle is the reciprocal of it's radius)
eg: Railway tracks where the curve changes into a straight track

Derived using [Fresnel Integrals](Fresnel%20Integrals.md)
