Distributions, also known as Schwartz Distributions are 

- The product of a distribution by a smooth function cannot be extended to an associative product on the space of distributions.
  
  Example: 
  If $p.v.\frac{1}{x}$ is the distribution obtained by the [[Cauchy Principal Value]],
  $(p.v.\frac{1}{x}(\phi)=\lim_{\epsilon\tends0^+}\integral_{\abs{x}\geq3}{\frac{\phi(x)}{x}dx}\text{for all}\phi\mathcalS(R)$
