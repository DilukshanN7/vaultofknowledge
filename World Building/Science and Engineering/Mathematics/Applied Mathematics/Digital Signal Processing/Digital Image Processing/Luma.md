In [Video](../../../../../../Video.md), luma represents the brightness in an image. Luma is typically paired with [Chrominance](Chrominance.md). Luma represents the black and white image, while chroma represents the colour image. 

Converting images to luma and chroma allows for [Chroma Subsampling](../../../../../../Chroma%20Subsampling.md), because human vision has finer spatial sensitivity to luminance differences than chromatic differences.
