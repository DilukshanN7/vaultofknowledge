Chrominance or chroma (C) is the signal used in video systems to convey colour information of the picture seperately from the accompanying [[luma]] signal.

It is usually represented by two [[colour difference]] components:
$U=B'-Y'$ (blue - luma)
$V=R'-Y'$ (red - luma)

In [[composite video]] signals, the U and V signals modulate a colour subcarrier signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal. The phase
