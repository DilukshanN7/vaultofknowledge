Dirac comb function, also known as shah function, impulse train or sampling function is an infinite series of [Dirac delta functions](Dirac%20Delta%20Function.md) seperated by intervals of some time period T.

**Formula:** $\text{ле}_T(t):=\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{\delta(t-kT)}$

The Cycrillic letter ле (sha) was chosen because the graph
