It is a branch of condensed matter physics that studies hydrodynamic-like systems which exhibit quantum mechanical behaviour.

One of the important areas of study in quantum hydrodynamics is that of [[superfluidity]].

The equations of quantum hydrodynamics are called Madelung equations, and they are equations fo
