Newton described the Laws of Motion as follows:

- First law: All objects continue to be in a state of rest or uniform motion unless and until an external force is applied
- Second law / Law of Inertia: All objects continue to be in a state of rest or motion unless and until an external force is applied
- Third law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
