We are commonly accustomed to the fluid state. Let me consider the liquid state specifically.

But liquids are on one hand pushed in by the atmospheric pressure, and on the other, due to gravity. There is also the pressure of the container, and the pressure of intermolecular forces of attraction, which works against the repulsion.

In free space, they would simply boil, since the internal energy of the particles is higher than the outside energy (or heat), and the liquid is not as bound together as they are compressed by the external forces.

In case of gases, they just spread out to infinity without the influence of gravity or a container.
