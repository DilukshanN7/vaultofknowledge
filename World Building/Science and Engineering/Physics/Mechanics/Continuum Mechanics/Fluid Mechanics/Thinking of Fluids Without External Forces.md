We are commonly accustomed to the fluid state. Let me consider the liquid state specifically.
# Liquid State
But liquids are on one hand pushed in by the atmospheric pressure, and on the other, due to gravity. There is also the pressure of the container, and the pressure of intermolecular forces of attraction, which works against the repulsion.

In free space, they would simply boil, since the internal energy of the particles is higher than the outside energy (or heat), and the liquid is not as bound together as they are compressed by the external forces.

So it's as if liquids are only held in place because something keeps hitting them from the outside, in other words, due to external heat of gases (which itself is due to gravity and the amount of gas).
# Gaseous State
In case of gases, they just spread out to infinity without the influence of gravity or a container.
# General Case of States of Matter
- High Energy, Low Attraction: Gases
- Medium Energy, Medium Attraction: Liquids
- Low Energy, High Attraction: Solids

It looks like Energy x Attraction remains a constant, with 
It's as if one always trades freedom for closeness.
