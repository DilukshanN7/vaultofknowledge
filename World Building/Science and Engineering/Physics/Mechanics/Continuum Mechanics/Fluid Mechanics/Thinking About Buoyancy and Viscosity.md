- Buoyancy is dependent on density, but viscosity isn't
- Pressure and Density are what contribute to buoyancy
- Intermolecular forces are what contribute to viscosity
- External pressure also contributes to viscosity, as that's what holds the fluid together. But dynamic pressure may not affect it (I'll need to see)
- Aside from internal pressure due to density, there is atmospheric pressure and gravitational force, and also the normal forces on the sides of the container.

P = P0 + pgh + 1/2pv^2 (P0 is the "static fluid pressure" (which should account for the container pressure too), and pgh is the "gravitational pressure" and 1/2pv^2 is the "dynamic pressure")

> I know A1v1 = A2v2, and with this, we can calculate the velocity of air leaving a bottle when it is opened in space, because without gravity and external pressure, the pressure inside the bottle is 1 atm, since we didn't push the air further when the bottle was closed while at earth.

> Different arrangements of the same charged particles can have a different close range effect (influencing the chemistry, for example, by hybridization of orbitals and thus generated dipole moment). However, the net effect is same outside the sphere of influence if you apply Gauss's law.
