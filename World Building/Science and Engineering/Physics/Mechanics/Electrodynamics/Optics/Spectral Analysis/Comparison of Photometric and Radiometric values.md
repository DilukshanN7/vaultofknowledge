- Reflectance
	- The reflectance of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in reflecting radiant energy. It is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is reflected at the boundary.
- Incandescence
	- Emission of light from a hot body due to its temperature
- Luminescence
	- Emission of light not due to heat
	- Types: Bioluminescence, Cathodoluminescence, Chemiluminescence, Crystalloluminescence, Electric Discharge, Electroluminescence, Electrochemiluminsecence, Photoluminescence (Fluorescence, Phosphorescence), Radioluminescence, Thermoluminescence
