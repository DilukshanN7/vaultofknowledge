Quantum Efficiency (QE) is the ratio of electrons generated per photon for a given wavelength.

QE is dimensionless as a ratio, but is closely related to [Spectral Responsivity](../../../../../../Creativity%20and%20Arts/Colour%20Theory/Physical%20Aspects%20of%20Colours/Spectral%20Responsivity.md), which is measured in Amps/Watt.

- QE for photographic films is around 10%
- QE for [CCD](../../../../Electronics%20and%20Electricity/Charge-Coupled%20Devices.md) is around 90%
