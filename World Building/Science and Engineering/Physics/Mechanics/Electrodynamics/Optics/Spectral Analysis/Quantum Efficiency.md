Quantum Efficiency (QE) is the ratio of electrons generated per photon for a given wavelength.

QE is dimensionless as a ratio, but is closely related to [[../../../../../../Creativity and Arts/Colour Theory/Physical Aspects of Colours/Spectral Responsivity]], which is measured in Amps/Watt.

- QE for photographic films is around 10%
- QE for [[../../../../Electronics and Electricity/Charge-Coupled Devices|CCD]] is around 90%
