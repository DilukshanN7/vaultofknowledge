Also known as ECAD (Electronic CAD)
It refers to the use of software for designing electronic systems.

# Steps in EDA
### Simulation
- Description (VHDL/Verilog)
- Simulation
### Design
- Logical Synthesis (Conversion of RTL Code to a Gate Level netlist)
- Post-Synthesis Simulation
	- Static Timing Analysis
- Placement
- Routing
- Power Optimization
### Verification
- Design Closure
- Post-Silicon Validation
### Post-Design Steps
- [[Design For Manufacturing]]
- Silicon Lifecycle Management
