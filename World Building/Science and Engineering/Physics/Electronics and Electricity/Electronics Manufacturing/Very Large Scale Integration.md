# Difficulties
- Process variation - As photolithography techniques get close to the fundamental laws of optics, achieving high accuracy in doping concentrations and etched wires are becoming more difficult and prone to errors due to variation.
- Stricter design rules - Due to lithography and etch issues with scaling, Design Rule Checking for layout has become increasingly stringent. This means designers would have to keep in mind a large number of rules when laying out custom circuits. This is reaching a point where design houses are now opting to switch to [[Electronic Design Automation]] (EDA/ECAD).
- Timing/Design closure - As clock frequencies tend to scale up, desingers are finding it more difficult to maintain low [[clock skew]] between high frequency clocks across the chip. This has led to the development of multicore and multi-processor architectures, since an overall speedup can be obtained even with lower clock frequency by using the computational power of all the cores.
