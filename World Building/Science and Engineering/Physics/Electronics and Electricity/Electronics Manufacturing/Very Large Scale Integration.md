# Difficulties
- Process variation - As photolithography techniques get close to the fundamental laws of optics, achieving high accuracy in doping concentrations and etched wires are becoming more difficult and prone to errors due to variation.
- Stricter design rules - Due to lithography and etch issues with scaling, Design Rule Checking
