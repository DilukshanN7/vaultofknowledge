### Bosons
They are subatomics particles with integer spin quantum numbers. They are 
Matter: Quarks, Leptons
Antimatter: Antiquarks, Antileptons

### Fermions
They are subatomics particles with integer spin quantum numbers.
Gauge Bosons, Higgs Boson
Gravitons (hypothetical)

### Hadrons

### Quasiparticles
- Three degrees of freedom of an electron within a molecule (charge, spin, orbital) can be seperated by the wavefunction into three particles: Holon, Spinon, Orbiton
- An electron that doesn't revolve around a nucleus lacks an orbital and hence is unsplittable, and is regarded as an elementary particle.
