It states that the universe cannot obey any symmetry apart from the [Poincare Symmetries](Poincare%20Symmetries.md) and the internal symmetries specific to each quantum fields. This theorem is under the assumption that all symmetries are quantified by numbers.

However, [Supersymmetry](Supersymmetry.md) postulates that fermions are represented by [Grassman Numbers](Grassman%20Numbers.md) and there could be a mapping from the [Grassman Numbers](Grassman%20Numbers.md) to ordinary numbers creating superpartners for fermions and bosons. This symmetric mapping is called [Supersymmetry](Supersymmetry.md).
