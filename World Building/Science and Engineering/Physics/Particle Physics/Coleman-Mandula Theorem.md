It states that the universe cannot obey any symmetry apart from the [[Poincare Symmetries]] and the internal symmetries specific to each quantum fields. This theorem is under the assumption that all symmetries are quantified by numbers.

However, [[Beyond the Standard Model/Supersymmetry]] postulates that fermions are represented by [[../Mechanics/Quantum Mechanics/Grassman Numbers]] and there could be a mapping from the [[../Mechanics/Quantum Mechanics/Grassman Numbers]] to ordinary numbers creating superpartners for fermions and bosons. This symmetric mapping is called [[Beyond the Standard Model/Supersymmetry]].
