Quantum Numbers describe the conserved quantities in a quantum mechanical system.

More technically, quantum numbers are eigenvalues of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian of a system. The Hamiltonian is an operation which when applied to a system gives the total energy of that system. So quantum numbers are quantities that can be known at the same time as the system's energy
