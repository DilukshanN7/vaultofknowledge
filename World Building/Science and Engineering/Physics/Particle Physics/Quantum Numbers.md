Quantum Numbers describe the conserved quantities in a quantum mechanical system.

More technically, quantum numbers are eigenvalues of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian of a system. The Hamiltonian is an operation which when applied to a system gives the total energy of that system. 
So quantum numbers correspond to quantities that can be known exactly at the same time as the system's 
energy and their corresponding eigenstates. [What are eigenstates and eigenvalues?]

Most quantum numbers are additive, but some like parity are multiplicative.
## For Electrons In Atomic Orbitals
- Principal Quantum Number (Shell)
- Azimuthal Quantum Number (Subshell)
- Magnetic Quantum Number (Orbital Orientation)
- Magnetic Spin Quantum Number (Electron Spin)
## For Total Angular Momentum
- Total Angular Momentum
- Projection of Total Angular Momentum along a specified axis
- Parity
