Spontaneous symmetric breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, whereby a physical system in a symmetric state ends up in an asymmetric state.

By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of physical laws (e.g. quantum mechanics) which are invariant under a symmetry transformation, so that any pair of outcomes differing only by that transformation have the same probability distribution.
