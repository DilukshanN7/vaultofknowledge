They are particles made from the combination of two or more elementary particles. Some examples are [Hadrons](hadrons.md), atoms, molecules and ions. They can either be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents.

### Composite Bosons
They have even number spin. Examples are:
- [Mesons](Mesons.md)
- Stable nuclei of even mass numbers, like deuterium, helium-4 (alpha particle), carbon-12 and lead-208

### Composite Fermions
They have odd spin. Examples are:
- [Baryons](Baryons.md)
- Nucleus of Carbon-13
- The ATOMs Helium-3, Deuterium
