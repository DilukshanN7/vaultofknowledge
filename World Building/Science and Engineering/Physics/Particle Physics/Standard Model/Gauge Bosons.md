They are the particles responsible for forces between other particles. The known force carrier bosons all have spin = 1 and are therefore known as vector bosons.

The hypothetical [Gravitons](gravitons.md) have spin = 2 and is a tensor boson. But it is not known whether it is a gauge boson as well.


There are four types of gauge bosons:
- [Photons](Photons.md) (they are the EM )
- [W Bosons](W%20and%20Z%20Bosons.md)
- [Z Bosons](W%20and%20Z%20Bosons.md)
- [Gluons](Gluons.md)
