They are the particles responsible for forces between other particles. The known force carrier bosons all have spin = 1 and are therefore known as vector bosons.

The hypothetical [[gravitons]] have spin = 2 and is a tensor boson. But it is not known whether it is a gauge boson as well.


There are four types of gauge
