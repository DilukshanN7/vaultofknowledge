### Fermions
They are subatomics particles with fractional spin quantum numbers. They obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. 
Matter: Quarks, Leptons
Antimatter: Antiquarks, Antileptons

### Bosons
They are subatomics particles with integer spin quantum numbers. They obey Bose-Einstein statistics.
Gauge Bosons: Photons, W and Z bosons, Eight types of Gluons, Gravitons (hypothetical)
Scalar Bosons: Higgs Boson

### Hadrons
They are composite particles.

### Quasiparticles
- Three degrees of freedom of an electron within a molecule (charge, spin, orbital) can be seperated by the wavefunction into three particles: Holon, Spinon, Orbiton
- An electron that doesn't revolve around a nucleus lacks an orbital and hence is unsplittable, and is regarded as an elementary particle.
