### [Fermions](Fermions.md)
They are subatomics particles with fractional spin quantum numbers. They obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. They are: 
- [Quarks](Quarks.md) and Antiquarks
- [Leptons](Leptons.md) and Antileptons

### [Bosons](Bosons.md)
They are subatomics particles with integer spin quantum numbers. They obey Bose-Einstein statistics. They are:
- [Gauge Bosons](Gauge%20Bosons.md): [Photons](Photons.md), [W and Z Bosons](W%20and%20Z%20bosons.md), Eight types of [Gluons](Gluons.md), [Gravitons](Gravitons.md) (hypothetical)
- [Scalar Bosons](Scalar%20Bosons.md): [Higgs Boson](Higgs%20Boson.md)

### [Hadrons](Hadrons.md)
They are [Composite Particles](composite%20particles.md) made by two or more quarks held together by [Strong Interactions](strong%20Interactions.md). Each hadron must fall under the category of either a boson or a fermion. They are of two types:
- [Baryons](Baryons.md)
- [Mesons](Mesons.md)

### Quasiparticles
#### Fermion-like
- Three degrees of freedom of an electron within a molecule (charge, spin, orbital) can be seperated by the wavefunction into three particles: Holon, Spinon, Orbiton
- An electron that doesn't revolve around a nucleus lacks an orbital and hence is unsplittable, and is regarded as an elementary particle.
#### Boson-like
- Cooper pairs, plasmons and phonons are observed to behave as bosons.
