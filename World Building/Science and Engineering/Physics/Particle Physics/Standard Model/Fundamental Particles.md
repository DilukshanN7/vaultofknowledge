### Fermions
They are subatomics particles with fractional spin quantum numbers. They obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. They are: 
- [[Quarks]] and Antiquarks
- [[Leptons]] and Antileptons

### Bosons
They are subatomics particles with integer spin quantum numbers. They obey Bose-Einstein statistics. They are:
- [[Gauge Bosons]]: [[Photons]], [[W and Z bosons]], Eight types of [[Gluons]], [[Gravitons]] (hypothetical)
- [[Scalar Bosons]]: [[Higgs Boson]]

### Hadrons
They are composite particles.

### Quasiparticles
- Three degrees of freedom of an electron within a molecule (charge, spin, orbital) can be seperated by the wavefunction into three particles: Holon, Spinon, Orbiton
- An electron that doesn't revolve around a nucleus lacks an orbital and hence is unsplittable, and is regarded as an elementary particle.
