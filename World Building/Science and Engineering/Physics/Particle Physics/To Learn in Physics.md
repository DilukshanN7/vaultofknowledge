1. Quantum Spin - Spinors - Spin Statistic Theorem - Knots (More on this and spinors, on PBS Space Time at YT)
	- Premise: Conservation of Angular Momentum
	- Einstein de-Haas effect - experiment involving a suspended iron cylinder subjected to a vertical magnetic field causing it to rotate
	- Electrons have a spin property, which is conserved when they are aligned by the magnetic field
	- Zeeman Effect: Zeeman, Lorentz figured out that while looking at specific wavelengths emitted by electrons when jumping between energy levels, these energy levels split when atoms are put in an external magnetic field 
		- Lorentz described this using the ideas of classical physics - that an electron being a spinning ball of charge moving in circles around an atom would lead to a magnetic moment - a dipole magnetic field. The different alignments of that orbital magnetic field relative to the external magnetic field turns one energy level into three.
		- Anomalous Zeeman effect - In some cases the magnetic field causes energy levels to split even further
		- One explanation was that each electron has its own magnetic spin
		- For this, electrons must be spinning balls
		- Pauli pointed out that in that case the electrons must be spinning faster than the speed of light - even if they were particles at all.
		- Pauli's called it classically non-describable two-valuedness
	- Quantum spin is therefore an intrinsic angular momentum, unlike classical angular momentum
	- Stern-Gelarch Experiment
	- Pauli's inclusion of spinors to Schrodinger's Equation
	- Dirac found a complete fix of Schrodinger's Equation to make it work with Relativity - it could only work by including spinors.
	- Electron spin only corrects orientation every 720 degrees.
		- One rotation causes a twist, another brings it back
		- Technically a spinor wavefunction has a phase that changes with orientation angle, and a 360 degree spin makes it out of phase from the starting point
	- Hans Ohanian, author of one of the most used Quantum textbooks, shown that you can derive the angular momentum and magnetic moment by looking at the energy and charge currents in the Dirac field, i.e. the quantum field surrounding the Dirac spinor, or the electron.
	- Particle described by spinors have half integer Spin QNs. +/- 1/2. They are fermions.
	- Bosons are described by vectors, not spinors. These rotations define how they interact with each other.

5. [[Quantum Field Theory]]
	- Derived because independent particles cannot explain how particles are the same everywhere, and also quantum mechanics does not work well with changing number of particles, e.g. an absorbed photon
	- QFT is a new mathematical framework that introduces a field
	- A mathematical field is like a fluid that fills spacetime, with each point populated by a mathematical object
	- The mathematical objects should obey some symmetries, as restricted by special relativity, called [[Poincare Symmetries]]
	- These are only respected by certain mathematical objects, and they are classified by a parameter known as spin.
	- Numbers - 0, Spinors - 1/2, Vectors - 1, 3/2, 2
	- Each symmetry forces the field to respect the conservation of certain quantities over time
		- Conservation of energy, momentum, angular momentum and velocity of the center of mass
	- The mathematical objects can contain symmetries of their own ()
