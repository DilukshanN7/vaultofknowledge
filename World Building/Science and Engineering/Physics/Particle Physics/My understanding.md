- Energy is the curvature of spacetime
- Spacetime is really just space, time is just what we choose to call it.
- We also call identifiable manifestations of energy as particles
- General Relativity takes a purely geometric approach


Can't angle be defined as `XY` x `YX`? Only two cartesian axes are required to represent the complete space.
So, the output would be `[0,360]` x `[0,360]`.
The output will be equal whenever `XY` = `YX`.

We cannot use another
Using a negative sign won't resolve this.

Also, in our current representation. Rotating by 90 degrees in any one of the axes defines a location accuratel
