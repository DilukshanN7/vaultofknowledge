- Energy is the curvature of spacetime
- Spacetime is really just space, time is just what we choose to call it.
- We also call identifiable manifestations of energy as particles
- General Relativity takes a purely geometric approach

There is a distance and orientation from a reference.
For a single observer pair, the orientation is inline, hence there is only a distance.

Can't angle be defined as `XY` x `YX`? Only two cartesian axes are required to represent the complete space.
So, the output would be `[0,360]` x `[0,360]`.
The output will be equal whenever `XY` = `YX`.

We cannot use another
Using a negative sign won't resolve this.

Also, in our current representation. Rotating by 90 degrees in any one of the axes defines a location accurately regardless of the rotation of the other axes, so for whichever axis came first. This seems wrong and related to the Gimbal lock.
Yes, the amount rotated varies from `max` to `0` as the first rotation goes from `0` to `90` degrees.

So we better use quaternions or something instead of spherical coordinates.
The XYZ coordinates also are not intuitive, as in with how we observe objects day-to-day.
