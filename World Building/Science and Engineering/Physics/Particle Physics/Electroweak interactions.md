This is a theory that combines two of the four fundamental forces, the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force into a single, electroweak force.

According to the electroweak theory, at very high energies, the universe has four components to the Higgs field, whose interactions are carried by four massless gauge bosons, similar to the photon, forming a complex scalar Higgs field doublet.

However, at low energies, the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down ([[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]) due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of electromagnetism, since one of the Higgs fields acquires a vacuum expectation value of 246 GeV.
