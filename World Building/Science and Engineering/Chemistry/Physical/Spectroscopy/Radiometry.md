Radiometry is a set of techniques in optics for measuring electromagnetic radiation.

It characterizes the distribution of radiation's power in space, as opposed to [Photometry](../../../Physics/Mechanics/Electrodynamics/Optics/Spectral%20Analysis/Photometry.md) which only considers the visible spectrum.

Radiometry is disctinct from quantum techniques such as photon counting.
