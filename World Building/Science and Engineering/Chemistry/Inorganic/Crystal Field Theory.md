Crystal Field Theory (CFT) 

It was developed by Hans Bethe and John Hasbrouck van Vleck in the 1930s. Later it was combined with the molecular orbital theory (MOT) to form a more realistic and complex Ligand Field Theory (LFT), which delivers insight into the chemical bonding of transitional metal complexes.
