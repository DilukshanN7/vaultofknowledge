IEEE 802.11, or 802.11x (not 802.11X) is a set of standards related to Wi-Fi networks.

# Evolution
802.11 was developed as a wireless local network alternative to Ethernet.
It was quickly improved by 802.11a and then 802.11b.
The evolutions are named with short letter suffixes (hence 802.11x)

The main Wi-Fi standards are:
- 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) [802.11a and 802.11b was developed together, but 802.11b was more affordable then]
- 802.11a (Wi-Fi 2)
- 802.11g (Wi-Fi 3)
- 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
- 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
- 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)
- 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8)
