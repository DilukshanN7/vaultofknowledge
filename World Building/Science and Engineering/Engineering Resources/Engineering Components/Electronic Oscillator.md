It is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating or alternating current (AC) signal, usually a sine wave, a square wave, or a triangle wave, powered by a DC source.

# Classification
## By the frequency of their signal
- Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO): Produces frequencies below 20 Hz
	- This term is used in the field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from audio frequency oscillators
- Audio Oscillator: Produces frequencies between 20 Hz to 20 kHz
- RF Oscillator
