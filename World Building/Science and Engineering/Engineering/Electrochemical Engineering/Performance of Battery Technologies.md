# Performance
Different cell chemistries perform differently. Firstly, we'll understand the basic traits of a battery's performance. 

A battery of a given size (mass or volume) can store a specific amount of charge, and the choice and size of electrodes will dictate the potential difference between them. The charge sets the capacity of the battery, and has units of Coulomb ($\text{C}$) or milliAmp-Hours ($\text{mAh}$) (since $\text{Q=It}$). The capacity multiplied by the voltage will give the energy contained by the battery, in units of Watt-Hours (Wh) (since $\text{E=VIt}$).

Not to mention the infamous equation $\text{E=mc}^2$, which underlies every process, and is helpful here when you understand energy in terms of mass transfer (chemical bonding energy being an example). Not very essential, but I find that the knowledge comes in handy at times.

The capacity per mass ($\text{Q/m}$) is called the specific charge (mAh/kg), and the energy per mass ($\text{E/m}$) is called the specific energy ($\text{Wh/kg}$). The capacity per volume (Q/V) is called the charge density ($\text{mAh/m}^3$), and the energy per volume ($\text{E/V}$) is called the energy density ($\text{Wh/m}^3$). Specific charge/energy can be converted to charge/energy densities by considering the physical density ($\text{kg/m}^3$) of the battery itself.
