Islam is a religion, much like many other religions, often misrepresented by taking words out of context. I'm not saying it's all right, but I'm saying that many times, people argue about specific verses without understanding the context. I've read several parts of the Quran to know the real context, and hence I can provide a summary of those verses and give you the right context from the Quran itself.
# The ones I can defend

# The ones I can't defend
- (Quran 3:32): "Say, "Obey Allah and the Messenger." But if they turn away - then indeed, Allah does not like the disbelievers."
	- It says follow Allah and the Messenger. Because of having to obey the Messenger, one also has to follow the Hadiths aside from the Quran, so it also brings in all the unfair practices, including the Shariah law and Jihad.
	- It can also be reasoned that the Quran can be used as a tool to verify what is right in the Jewish Tanekh and follow that. After all, the Talmuds are the base scriptures of Islam, and the Quran is presented as the final word clearing up the mistakes that have accumulated in the Torah over the years.
