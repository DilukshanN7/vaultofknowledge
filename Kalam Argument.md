It is the argument used by Muslims to prove that god exists. 

KalƒÅm, or Islamic scholastic theology is the science which is concerned with firmly establishing religious beliefs by adducing proofs and with banishing doubts.

The three disputed sources of Islamic law were the ahl Al-Kalam (philosophy), ahl al-Ra'y (common sense) and ahl al-Hadith (hadith).

So the argument goes:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause of its existence.
2. The universe began to exist.
	2.1 Argument based on the impossibility of an actual infinite:
		2.11 An actual infinite cannot exist.
		2.12 An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.  
		2.13 Therefore, an infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.
	2.2 Argument based on the impossibility of the formation of an actual infinite by successive addition:
		2.21 A collection formed by successive addition cannot be actually infinite.  
		2.22 The temporal series of past events is a collection formed by successive addition.  
		2.23 Therefore, the temporal series of past events cannot be actually infinite.
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence.

Why can't an infinite exist?

Just imagine a sea of water, and nothing else. Imagine it stretches on forever, and there is no end to it. Si

What is 2.2?
2.2 is described simply as that an infinite distance cannot be traversed. For example, in time, if the past was infinite, then today would never arrive.

But I must ask, to arrive, where do you start from? You have to start somewhere, and if you pick a point, you have a finite distance from there! You can't start from the "beginning", because there's no beginning in infinity! But if you pick a point, you have a present.
