	- They make features paid later
	- The point where price becomes unfair
- IDEA: Certified Sand Castle, Kite and Bridge Construction expert | The reason we can't scale up sand castles or aircrafts are because the fundamental forces are in inverse square ratio, but scaling is linear; Also that the interconnected forces increase with more particles
- IDEA: Adjusting pricing based on supply transport charges
- WRITING-PROMPT: The smaller you zoom a Mandelbort set, the chances of getting lost in open space is high. Imagine if you were like AntMan, but you have to touch a particle to come back to being a human.

- From 2023, Intel Core, Celeron and Pentium will be replaced with Intel Processor lineup. Pentium and Celeron are brands, but Core is a trademark. The upcoming Processor will also be a trademark. Also i3 N-Series, Processor N-Series and U-Series are being introduced, which do not contain the generation number.
- Aircrafts
	- Aerostats (lighter than air) - Balloons (Unpowered), Airships (Powered) | Aerodynes (Heavier than air) - Aerodynamic lift, Powered lift (VTOL)
	- Rockets don't depend on aerodynamic lift, and can do spaceflight
