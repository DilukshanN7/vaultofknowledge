# The claim that music is unlawful

“Whoever says that all music is prohibited, let him also claim that the songs of the birds are prohibited”- Abu Hamed Al Gazzali

The Quran makes no mention of music being forbidden; rather, it says:

“You shall not utter lies with your own tongues stating: "This is Halal (lawful), and this is Haram (unlawful)," to fabricate lies and attribute them to GOD. Surely, those who fabricate lies and attribute them to GOD will never succeed” (Al Quran #16:116).

During the time of prophet, it was common to buy singing girls. Some people who bought them would made them sing so loudly, So that Muslims cannot pray. They would purchase them with evil intention of distracting others from the path of Allah.

So, this does not include that music itself is haram. But clearly states that using music to mislead from the path of Allah is haram.

Often quoted is the Ayah (31:6): But there are some who employ theatrics,1 only to lead others away from Allah’s Way—without any knowledge—and to make a mockery of it. They will suffer a humiliating punishment.

But theatrics here refer to not music or dances itself, but their use to distract a person from Allah's Way. Even as a secular person, I can see the point in this, because theatrics are often deployed as a tool for deception.

"Indeed, this Quran does guide to that which is most straight(Arabic: Aqwamu), and gives glad tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they shall have a magnificent reward"

16.116

"And do not assert with your own tongues by saying the lie that "This is lawful and this is forbidden" so that you invent a lie against God. For those who ascribe false things to God, will never prosper"

31:006 "But there are, among men, those who purchase idle (Arabic: Lahwa-l) tales (Arabic: Hadith), without knowledge, to mislead from the Path of God and throw ridicule (on the Path): for such there will be a Humiliating Penalty"

By this, it looks like the Hadiths are worse than music itself, because music by itself is not prohibited by the Quran, only its misuse is. Also, by the literal translation of Ayah 31:6, it says "idle tales", which more conventionally means "utter nonsense". Hadith can be said to fit this description, as it makes a further interpretation of the Quran, which itself was to be interpreted on its own.
