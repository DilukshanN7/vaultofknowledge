- Faraday's Law
- Ampere's Law with Maxwell's Addition
	- Maxwell's Addition is displacement current, which is defined in terms of the displacement current field, D.

The asymmetry of many terms in the magnetic field not having a counterpart for the electric field is because we do not have [[magnetic monopoles]], or magnetons.

Also, displacement current comes from time varying electric fields, but when it  we don't have a charge
