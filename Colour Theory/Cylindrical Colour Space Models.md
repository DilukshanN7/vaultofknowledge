[[Hue]]-[[Colourfulness|Chroma]]-[[Lightness|Luminance]] (HCL) or LCh refers to cylindrical colour space models that are designed to accord with human perception of colour with three parameters.

Example: HSL and HSV are cylindrical transformations of [[RGB Colour Spaces]]

### Representations
- LCh / HLC - cylindrical representation of CIELAB
- HCL colour space - commonly  used name for cyclindrical representation of CIELUV
- LCh(ab) is sometimes used to differentiate with $L^*C^*h(uv)$

They are popular in information visualization to present data without the bias implicit in varying saturation.

They are designed to have the characteristics of both the cylindrical translations of the [[RGB Colour Spaces|RGB Colour Space]], such as HSL and HSV, and the [[CIELAB]] colour space.
