They are any [[additive colour spaces]] based on the [[RGB Colour Model]].

An RGB colour space is defined by [[chromaticity]] coordinates of red, green and blue [[Primary Colours|additive primaries]], the [[white point]] which is usually defined by a [[standard illuminant]] and the [[transfer function]] which is also known as the [[tone response curve]] or [[gamma]].
