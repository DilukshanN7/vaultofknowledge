This is the web view of my knowledgebase. I hope to turn this site into something useful which I can share with my friends, and everyone else as well. Most of the notes are in the **World Building/Science and Engineering** folder.\n\nThe title for this site was inspired by a location in the game Sky: Children of The Light with the same name.\n\nThis website was generated in HTML using [ObsidianHTML](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html).\nThe GitHub repository for this page is available at https://github.com/blacklightpy/vaultofknowledge\n\n### Navigation\n- There is directory view at the left side, to browse through the folders.\n- There is a search button at the top for searching notes.\n- There is a small graph view at the bottom, and a full page graph view button at the top. You can switch between 2D and 3D views to visualize the connections between notes. In the small graph view, left clicking a note opens the note, and right click just selects the note in graph view. In the full page graph view, it is the other way round.\n\n> [!Previous intro]-\n>Hi there! This method of taking notes is called a [[Zettelkasten]], or connected atomic notes. It is more commonly referred to as a second brain. The purpose of taking notes this way is to build a lifelong store of information.\n>\n>You can explore the notes using the graph, sidebar index (at the bottom for mobiles), search bar and links within pages.\n>\n>I wrote the notes myself in Obsidian, but I used [obsidian-zola](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola) for publishing the vault because I was too lazy to write my own publishing system. I couldn't upload it as it is because then the markdown formatting wouldn't get rendered. \n>\n>So this site isn't perfect (as I want it to be).\n>\n>**Why did I publish this now, then?**\n>- I wanted to publish this since February this year (2022), but I waited for writing my own publishing system, but I got busier with college work, and decided that it's better to do something rather than waiting to make it perfect and not doing anything.\n> - Also having a public knowledgebase helps motivate me to maintain a better knowledgebase, and also help me share knowledge with others and hopefully do some cool projects together.\n>    \n>    I will write my own publishing system later to fix those problems. So consider this an early version of my site. There's also some personal information as well, but I don't mind it being there. I'll also be adding a blog and other cool stuff, as listed here: [[Personal Website Ideas]]\n>    \n>    **What's functional, and how to use:**\n> - There is a search bar for quick access.\n> - All notes are propely visible in my [[github.com/blacklightpy/Obsidian-Notes-backup|GitHub repo]]\n> - Folders are at the bottom of the index. 👉 represents subfolders.\n> - Subfolders three levels deep are not listed in the index. Those notes can be found in the graph and using the search bar.\n>   \n> **What doesn't work right:**\n> - Folder heirarchy is not easily visible.\n> - Not all folders are listed in the sidebar.\n> - Readability is hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n","file_path":"home.md","cover":"","created_at":"2023-08-21T20:23:32.200Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T20:23:32.200Z","is_daily":false,"id":"home.md"},"Homelab.md":{"title":"Homelab","content":"\n- Nextcloud\n- YUNOHost\n- Jellyfin\n- ONLYOFFICE Workspace\n\n- Heimdall Dashboard\n- Yacht Container Manager\n\t- Portainer (more feature rich)\n\t- Rancher by SUSE (Advanced Kubernetes manager based on kubectl etc.)","file_path":"Homelab.md","cover":"","created_at":"2023-09-17T20:00:31.831Z","updated_at":"2023-09-17T20:00:31.831Z","is_daily":false,"id":"Homelab.md"},"Identity Protocols.md":{"title":"Identity Protocols","content":"# Record Keeping\n- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)\n- Domain Name Service (DNS)\n\n# Authentication\nUsed to verify a user\n\n- Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL): \n\t- SASL is an authentication protocol base for Apache.

It can do this if it is a wave. A wave transports momentum via its waving motion and not by physically transporting an object with mass. \"Momentum\" is the directional property of an object in motion that describes its ability to influence another object upon impact. An object with high momentum (such as a truck) can greatly influence the object it collides with (such as a barrel).
