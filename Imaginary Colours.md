They are colours that don't exist physically.

For example, in [[LMS Colour Space]], there are overlaps for wavelengths between L, M ans S cone cells. So some combinations like non-zeo M values and zero L and S values are impossible.

Also, in a normal trichromatic additive colour space like [[RGB Colour Spaces]],
