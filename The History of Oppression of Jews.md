The Jews were oppressed all throughout history, because of their faith. The Babylonians and the Romans attacked their lands, but they preserved their identity. The Christians tossed them around throughout Europe and deprived them of equal rights. The Muslims did not really attack the Jews for being different, but they still thought they were stupid, and the attacks were due to violation of peaceful treaties. Jews and Arabs went along fairly well whenever peace treaties were followed, and they didn't have to follow Islam. Later on Muslims only became less secular due to threats from non-Muslims such as Europeans.

> [!NOTE] History of Antisemitism
> ## Pre-Christian Roman Empire
> - Tiberius forbade Judaism in Rome
> - After the Jewish Roman wars, Hadrian renamed Judea to Syria Palaestina and Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina to erase the history of the Jewish religion
> - After 70, Jews and Jewish proselytes were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the Jewish Tax
> - After 135, they were banned from entering Aelia Capitolina except for the day of Tisha B'Av
> ## Rise of Christianity in Roman Empire
> - Until Constantine's time, for a while Christians were persecuted more for trying to start a new religion, and for their criticism of the Gods that the Romans believed to have blessed their city, stating "all the gods of the heathens are devils."
> - Christians, unlike Jews didn't contain themselves to a single state, and wanted to convert other people
> - 137 AD: Christians started blaming all Jews for all time, for deicide of Jesus
> - Christianity became to official religion of Rome
> - 438 AD: Codex Theodosianus barred Jews from civil service, army and legal profession. Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts were restricted. Synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could only be repaired if they were in the danger of collapsing. Synagogues either fell into ruin, were destroyed, or converted to churches.
> ## Rise of Islam
> - The series of conflicts addressed in the Quran - with Banu Nadir, Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Qurayza
> - 628 AD: After the Battle of Trench, there were still some conflicts, most notable being the Battle of Khaybar. The Banu Nadir members, who claimed to be the descendants of Aaron, moved to Khaybar after their expulsion from Medina city in 625. There they had firearms and weapons, and were plotting to attack the Muslims again.
> - After the conflict, they remained peacefully in the Oasis, but later the Caliph Umar expelled them in 642 AD to the newly conquered regions of Syria and Iraq, claiming that Mohammed before his death said that the two religions cannot exist together in the Hejaz.
> ## Protection and Persecution under Islam
> - From the 9th century onwards, the medieval Islamic world imposed "dhimmi" or "protected" status on Christian and Jewish minorities. Nevertheless, Jews were granted more freedom to practise their religion in the Muslim world than they were in Christian Europe.
> - Jewish communities in Spain thrived under tolerant Muslim rule during the Spanish Golden Age and Cordova became a centre of Jewish culture.
> - But when Almoravids entered North Africa, they started pogroms against the Jews of Cordova in 1011 and Granada massacre in 1066. Later by 1147 they formed the Almohad Caliphate formed and started treating the dhimmis harshly.
> - Faced with death or conversion, many fled. Some went to more tolerant Muslim nations, while others went northward to growing Christian kingdoms.
> - Destruction of Synagogues were ordered in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in the Middle Ages.
> - 6,000 Jews were killed by a Muslim mob during the 1033 Fez massacre.
> - There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465

> - Many Jews viewed the deaths of Rhineland Jews as a sacrifice
> - They started having suicidal thoughts, which were sins, but were honourable in the face of a larger enemy
> - They killed children because it was better to die innocent than convert. This was what would've led to blood libel accusations later on.
> - The Catholic Church condemned the massacres, and gave protection to the Jews, but only if they didn't threaten Christianity and remained submissive to their rule.
> - Second Crusade
> 	- Jewish money was used for financing the crusade, and Jews were attacked too, but not on the scale of Rhineland
> 	- 
> - ### Persecution in England, France and Holy Roman Empire

> [!NOTE]
> Europe has blamed the Jews for an encyclopedia of sins.
> - The Church blamed the Jews for killing Jesus;
> - Voltaire blamed the Jews for inventing Christianity.
> - Jews were usurers and well-poisoners and spreaders of disease
> - Jews were the creators of both communism and capitalism;
> - they were clannish but also cosmopolitan;
> - cowardly and warmongering;
> - self-righteous moralists and defilers of culture.
> 
> Ideologues and demagogues of many permutations have understood the Jews to be a singularly malevolent force standing between the world and its perfection. 

> [!NOTE] Different Nations
> US: A western stranger nation, who merely adopted Christianity from the Spaniards, but are more capitalist
> Jews: A persecuted identity, who were forced to develop capitalism as the only means of survival
> Arabs: A community close to the Jews, where Islam originated
> Christians: A community of historic Jews who were convinced that Jesus was their Messiah, and went on converting everyone to accept Jesus Christ as god in human form
> Indians: 

> All Christian institutions in India are funded by the imperial British.
> Britain established Christian missionaries, schools and hospitals in India with better services.
> These private hospitals could've shared their profits to help bring up the standards of other government hospitals, but they chose not to.
> UK also funds India a lot as business investments.

> About Christians:
> My dad told me how he knew a Christian who would always go to the Church and confess his misdeeds every weekend. But after the confession, he would feel cleared of his sins, and he'd think to himself that now he's earned the right to sin again for the weekend. 
> 
> I used to think that Christians would only not refrain from sinning because they could always confess, but I never thought that they would sin routinely just because they just earned the right to sin. Again, this is a misuse of Christianity, because it is said that a true believer of Christ would at least feel the need to turn away from his sins. But you know, people can be mentally ill, such as having ADHD.
>
> I'm not sure if I'm missing some context here, such as if the sins are just human nature, as I'd say, about how religions are fundamentally restrictive of human nature, and in that sense, Christianity does help it in a slight sense. Because there is still the guilt of being a sinner for one's entire life.

	- Marx said that Jews are the embodiment of capitalism, which was correct, as that's how they had come to be under persecution. He however also questioned if they could be politically emancipated. His idea was that Judaism is so closely connected with capitalism, so without dropping that identity, society would never be free from capitalism.
> [!NOTE]
> - > Karl Marx, 1843, [On The Jewish Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jewish_Question "On the Jewish Question"), argued that Judaism is not only a religion, because it is an attitude of alienation from the world resulting from the ownership of money and private property, and this feeling of alienation is not exclusive to the Jews. Rather than forcibly converting Jews to Christianity, he proposed the implementation of a program of [anti-Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism "Anti-capitalism"), in order to liberate the world from Judaism, thus defined. By framing his revolutionary economic and political project as the liberation of the world from Judaism, Marx expressed a "messianic desire" that was itself "[quite Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersessionism "Supersessionism"),"[[90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Judaism#cite_note-FOOTNOTENirenberg20134-96)] according to [David Nirenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nirenberg "David Nirenberg").
