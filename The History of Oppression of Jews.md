The Jews were oppressed all throughout history, because of their faith. The Babylonians and the Romans attacked their lands, but they preserved their identity. The Christians tossed them around throughout Europe and deprived them of equal rights. The Muslims did not really attack the Jews for being different, but they still thought they were stupid, and the attacks were due to violation of peaceful treaties. Jews and Arabs went along fairly well whenever peace treaties were followed, and they didn't have to follow Islam. Muslims paid Zakat and Jews paid Jizah as taxes, so they both went along fairly well. Later on Muslims only became less secular due to threats from non-Muslims such as Europeans.

> [!NOTE] Regarding Taxes
> 
> Zakat was given to the poor, but Jizah was given to the state. The definition wasn't clear in the Quran, so they used Hadith for it. Even poor people had to pay Jizah, but sick and disabled people, etc. didn't have to. But the point was, Jizah was still better than forced conversion or extermination as happened in Europe. Well, this is just normal tax collected in every state.
> 
> Nowadays, it's the same tax, but Zakat still remains the offering of the Muslims in the name of Allah, which others just pay it to the state.
> 
> Non-Muslims didn't have to fight for Muslim religious wars. So this tax was held to support those who protected them.
> 
> About Zakat: https://en.wikishia.net/view/Zakat
> 
> >Elon Musk would pay $1000 in Jizya in the most expensive caliphates I could find.  
> > Elon Musk, if he were Muslim, would end up paying a wealth tax that would be $7.9 Billion. Unless I’ve misplaced a zero somewhere, I think that’s 790 million percent more.
> 
> > Muslims also have to pay a yearly tax called Zakat. Zakat is even binding on property and jewellery. Zakat should also be paid in the form of food as well. The Jizya is not binding on the property of the Christians and Jews.
> > 
> > Abu Bakr fought against the Muslims who didn't pay Zakat so it doesn’t seem to discriminate against the Christians and Jews.
> > 
> > If they go against the Islamic rule and government they deserve to be punished. What else was Abu Bakr supposed to do? In America if someone does not pay their taxes they can go to jail. Does that make America unjust? In China they kill tax evaders:

> > 
> > Zakah is one of the 5 pillars of Islam and it is compulsory on everyone. It is compulsory even on the non-Muslim, this is called Jizya. Jizya does not degrade the non-Muslim people, it actually brings equality.
> > 
> > The Jizya is a tax levied on non-Muslims in lieu of military service which is compulsory for Muslims but not for non-Muslims. The Non-Muslims paying Jizya were exempt from compulsory military service in a Muslim State but were entitled to full protection.

> [!NOTE] History of Antisemitism
> ## Pre-Christian Roman Empire
> - Tiberius forbade Judaism in Rome
> - After the Jewish Roman wars, Hadrian renamed Judea to Syria Palaestina and Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina to erase the history of the Jewish religion
> - After 70, Jews and Jewish proselytes were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the Jewish Tax
> - After 135, they were banned from entering Aelia Capitolina except for the day of Tisha B'Av
> ## Rise of Christianity in Roman Empire
> - Until Constantine's time, for a while Christians were persecuted more for trying to start a new religion, and for their criticism of the Gods that the Romans believed to have blessed their city, stating "all the gods of the heathens are devils."

> - 137 AD: Christians started blaming all Jews for all time, for deicide of Jesus
> - Christianity became to official religion of Rome
> - 438 AD: Codex Theodosianus barred Jews from civil service, army and legal profession. Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts were restricted. Synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could only be repaired if they were in the danger of collapsing. Synagogues either fell into ruin, were destroyed, or converted to churches.
> ## Rise of Islam
> - The series of conflicts addressed in the Quran - with Banu Nadir, Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Qurayza
> - 628 AD: After the Battle of Trench, there were still some conflicts, most notable being the Battle of Khaybar. The Banu Nadir members, who claimed to be the descendants of Aaron, moved to Khaybar after their expulsion from Medina city in 625. There they had firearms and weapons, and were plotting to attack the Muslims again.
> - After the conflict, they remained peacefully in the Oasis, but later the Caliph Umar expelled them in 642 AD to the newly conquered regions of Syria and Iraq, claiming that Mohammed before his death said that the two religions cannot exist together in the Hejaz.
> ## Protection and Persecution under Islam
> - From the 9th century onwards, the medieval Islamic world imposed "dhimmi" or "protected" status on Christian and Jewish minorities. Nevertheless, Jews were granted more freedom to practise their religion in the Muslim world than they were in Christian Europe.
> - Jewish communities in Spain thrived under tolerant Muslim rule during the Spanish Golden Age and Cordova became a centre of Jewish culture.
> - All these incidents were under the Almoravid Dynasty / Almohad Caliphate in North Africa
> 	- But when Almoravids entered North Africa, they started pogroms against the Jews of Cordova in 1011 and Granada massacre in 1066. Later by 1147 they formed the Almohad Caliphate formed and started treating the dhimmis harshly.
> 	- Faced with death or conversion, many fled. Some went to more tolerant Muslim nations, while others went northward to growing Christian kingdoms.
> 	- Destruction of Synagogues were ordered in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in the Middle Ages.
> 	- 6,000 Jews were killed by a Muslim mob during the 1033 Fez (Morocco) massacre.

> - They started with the goal of recapturing Jerusalem
> - First Crusade
> 	- It was accompanied by the People's Crusade against the Jews in Germany, France and England
> 		- 1096: Rhineland Massacres killed about 2000 Jews
> 	- They massacred the Jews of Rhineland instead of attacking the Jews
> 	- Siege of Jerusalem, where Muslims and Jews fought side by side to defend the city
> 	- They Jews decided to prepare for their death inside the synagogue
> 	- They (Franks) surrounded and burned down the synagogue over their heads
> 	- The captured Jews from Al-Aqsa's Dome of The Rock and the native Christians were made to clean up the slain
> 	- Some were taken as PoW, but many of them were beheaded or thrown into the sea en-route
> 	- Some Jews were rescued by the Karaite Jews of Ashkelon with help from their people in Alexandria
> - Many Jews viewed the deaths of Rhineland Jews as a sacrifice
> - They started having suicidal thoughts, which were sins, but were honourable in the face of a larger enemy
> - They killed children because it was better to die innocent than convert. This was what would've led to blood libel accusations later on.
> - The Catholic Church condemned the massacres, and gave protection to the Jews, but only if they didn't threaten Christianity and remained submissive to their rule.
> - Second Crusade
> 	- Jewish money was used for financing the crusade, and Jews were attacked too, but not on the scale of Rhineland
> 	- 
> ### Persecution in England, France and Holy Roman Empire
> - Christians accused the Jews of blood libels (drinking the blood of Christians) to mock the Last Supper and having superpowers by making deals with the devil.
> - 1349: The Jews were accused of poisoning the wells and causing Black Death, and one of them was corced into confessing that they did it, and all Jews of Strasbourg, France were burned alive on 14 Feb.

> - Martin Luther King started the Protestant reformation and criticized the Jews harshly, but later on said that Jews should be treated with Christian love, so that they may receive the Lord
> - The disappearance and death of a boy named Simon of Trent was blamed on the Jews, which fuelled antisemitism at the time. He was mutilated and his blood was drained.
> ##17th Century
> ## 18th Century (Age of Enlightenment)
> - The age of enlightenment saw the dismantling of archaic, corporate and hierarchical forms of society in favour of individual equality of citizens before the law
> 	- How this would affect the previously autonomous, but subordinated Jews became known as the Jewish Question
> 	- Enhanced civil rights were gradually extended to the Jews, but only on the condition that they abandon many aspects of their previous identity to fit in with the rest of society

> - Tsar Alexander III of Russia hated the Jews, because he believed they had a role in his father's murder
> - Jews were allowed reside to the west of Pale of Settlement, but not beyond that. The land was not good for agriculture, and Jews were in poverty.
> - Tsar Alexander III started many pogroms against the Jews
> - So the Jews moved to Europe, and the people hated it.
> - Arthur Balfour headed the Aliens Act 1905, limiting Jewish immigration
> - He didn't want Britain to become the dumping ground for the scum of Europe
> - ## Reduction of Antisemitism
> - Protestant Reformation
> - Rise of capitalism in England in the 19th century without a notable Jewish presence reduced the blame on Jews
> - Antisemitism was lower, in addition to US and Britain, in English speaking countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa due to cultural acceptance. The Quebec region of Canada still had higher levels of antisemitism because they are French, and has a long history of Catholic hostility.

> [!NOTE]
> Europe has blamed the Jews for an encyclopedia of sins.
> - The Church blamed the Jews for killing Jesus;
> - Voltaire blamed the Jews for inventing Christianity.
> - Jews were usurers and well-poisoners and spreaders of disease
> - Jews were the creators of both communism and capitalism;
> - they were clannish but also cosmopolitan;
> - cowardly and warmongering;
> - self-righteous moralists and defilers of culture.
> 
> Ideologues and demagogues of many permutations have understood the Jews to be a singularly malevolent force standing between the world and its perfection. 

> [!NOTE] Different Nations
> US: A western stranger nation, who merely adopted Christianity from the Spaniards, but are more capitalist
> Jews: A persecuted identity, who were forced to develop capitalism as the only means of survival
> Arabs: A community close to the Jews, where Islam originated
> Christians: A community of historic Jews who were convinced that Jesus was their Messiah, and went on converting everyone to accept Jesus Christ as god in human form
> Indians: 

> All Christian institutions in India are funded by the imperial British.
> Britain established Christian missionaries, schools and hospitals in India with better services.
> These private hospitals could've shared their profits to help bring up the standards of other government hospitals, but they chose not to.
> UK also funds India a lot as business investments.

> About Christians:
> My dad told me how he knew a Christian who would always go to the Church and confess his misdeeds every weekend. But after the confession, he would feel cleared of his sins, and he'd think to himself that now he's earned the right to sin again for the weekend. 
> 
> I used to think that Christians would only not refrain from sinning because they could always confess, but I never thought that they would sin routinely just because they just earned the right to sin. Again, this is a misuse of Christianity, because it is said that a true believer of Christ would at least feel the need to turn away from his sins. But you know, people can be mentally ill, such as having ADHD.
>
> I'm not sure if I'm missing some context here, such as if the sins are just human nature, as I'd say, about how religions are fundamentally restrictive of human nature, and in that sense, Christianity does help it in a slight sense. Because there is still the guilt of being a sinner for one's entire life.

	- Marx said that Jews are the embodiment of capitalism, which was correct, as that's how they had come to be under persecution. He however also questioned if they could be politically emancipated. His idea was that Judaism is so closely connected with capitalism, so without dropping that identity, society would never be free from capitalism.
> [!NOTE]
> - > Karl Marx, 1843, [On The Jewish Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jewish_Question "On the Jewish Question"), argued that Judaism is not only a religion, because it is an attitude of alienation from the world resulting from the ownership of money and private property, and this feeling of alienation is not exclusive to the Jews. Rather than forcibly converting Jews to Christianity, he proposed the implementation of a program of [anti-Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism "Anti-capitalism"), in order to liberate the world from Judaism, thus defined. By framing his revolutionary economic and political project as the liberation of the world from Judaism, Marx expressed a "messianic desire" that was itself "[quite Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersessionism "Supersessionism"),"[[90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Judaism#cite_note-FOOTNOTENirenberg20134-96)] according to [David Nirenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nirenberg "David Nirenberg").
