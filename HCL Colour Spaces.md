[[Hue]]-[[Colourfulness|Chroma]]-[[Lightness|Luminance]] (HCL) or LCh refers to cylindrical colour space models that are designed to accord with human perception of colour with three parameters.

They are designed to have the characteristics of both the cylindrical translations of the [[RGB Colour Spaces|RGB Colour Space]], such as HSL and HSV, and the [[CIELAB]] colour space.

### Representations
- LCh / HLC - cylindrical representation of CIELAB
- HCL colour space - commonly  used name for cyclindrical representation of CIELUV
- LCh(ab) is sometimes used to differentiate with $L^*C^*h(uv)$
