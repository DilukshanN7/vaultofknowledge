- Interlaced
- Interlaced video is a technique for doubling the percieved frame rate of a video without consuming more bandwidth. It only contains two fields fo a video frame captured conescutively. This enhances motion perception and reduces flicker by taking advantage of the phi phenomenon.

		- Video
			- Video Frames were represented as analog waveforms in an analog raster scan across the screen
				- In raster scan the image is divided into a sequence of scan lines
				- Scan lines are transmitted as analog signals
				- Analog TV has scan lines but no scan pixels, instead the signal varies along the scan line
					- They normally used interlaced scan
				- Digital TV systems represent images as a raster of pixels
			- Analog blanking intervals seperated frames
