I do not think Abrahamic religions present the "word of god" as much as the "word of civilization". "Word" is the keyword here. The origin of Abrahamic religions dates back to the time when civilization originated and writing was invented, in Ancient Mesopotamia. Writing systems as an improvement to language gave people a tool to settle down and form stable societies based on agriculture rather move around as hunter gatherers. Sumerian cuneiforms were invented before it developed into other Semitic languages in the region. Egyptian Hieroglyphics were another system, developed independently with Egyptian civilization, which was formed near the Nile river.

So it is reasonable that a religion took some time to develop, and after a couple of years, when faced with the question of existence, one person could've said that long ago god created mankind and through a series of generations, we got to where we are now. It also makes sense to say that all the problems began when humans ate the apple of intelligence, because the ability of question nature is the root of all human problems. That was the entire problem with maintaining a united civilization, and the only way to bring together people would be to unite them under a religion.

For this reason, religions have their roots
