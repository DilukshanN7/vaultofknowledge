# Key Points
- Energy is transmitted by the electric field that flows around the wires, not by the flow of electrons
- The wire acts as a wave guide.

- Ohm's law is a good approximation, and comes into effect after the circuit has solved the potential path.
- Electrons are not particles, but for most use cases, it's easier to think of them as particles.

- Free electrons in a conductor will move at the Fermi velocity in random directions. The net velocity will be 0.
- When a potential is applied, they will move about at a drift velocity towards one direction.
	- $v_d=\mu E$
	- Can be reformulated as $v_d = J/ne = I/nAe$, where $n$ is the charge carrier number density ($N/V$) and $e$ is the charge of the charge carrier
	- Also as $v_d = \dfrac{m \sigma \Delta V}{\rho e f l}$, where $m$ is the molecular mass ($M/N_0$), $\sigma$ is the conductivity, $\Delta V$ is the voltage, $\rho$ is the density, $e$ is the electric charge, $f$ is the number of free electrons, $l$ is the length of the conductor.
		- Math checks out :p
- Why this happens is a bit more complicated
