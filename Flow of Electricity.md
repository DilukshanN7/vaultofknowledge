# Key Points
- Energy is transmitted by the electric field that flows around the wires, not by the flow of electrons
- The wire acts as a wave guide.

- Ohm's law is a good approximation, and comes into effect after the circuit has solved the potential path.
- Electrons are not particles, but for most use cases, it's easier to think of them as particles.

- When free, electrons in a conductor will move at the Fermi velocity. The net velocity will be
