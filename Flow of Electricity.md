# Key Points
- Energy is transmitted by the electric field that flows around the wires, not by the flow of electrons
- The wire acts as a wave guide.

- Ohm's law is a good approximation, and comes into effect after the circuit has solved the potential path.
- Electrons are not particles, but for most use cases, it's easier to think of them as particles.

- Free electrons in a conductor will move at the Fermi velocity in random directions. The net velocity will be 0.
- When a potential is applied, they will move about at a drift velocity.
- Why this happens is a bit more complicated
