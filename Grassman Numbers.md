They are values generated by Grassman function.
Their property is that they are anticommutative. That is:

If $\theta_a$ and $\theta_b$ are two Grassman numbers,
then $\theta_a$ $\theta_b$ = -$\theta_b$ $\theta_a$

Field values are 
They are used to complete the missing elementary particles of the standard model in the theory of [[Supersymmetry]]
