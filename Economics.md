Transport:

It takes energy to transport materials.
Transport systems are build with routes.
The vehicles have a specific size.

The size of the vehicle affects the transport cost, much more than the amount of materials transported.
Therefore, if the vehicle is underutilized, transport cost will be higher than optimal in the long run.
