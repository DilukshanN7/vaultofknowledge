## Against "No incentive to innovate"

This is often used as an argument against "right to repair" and "capitalism". This plays on the feelings of an individual to the word "innovation" as something new and better, leading to "progress". "Innovative", "better" and "progress" are all good to have, which is why a person is encouraged to defend these ideas. However, this argument simply skews the true meaning 

People will be interested in new technology that actually serves a purpose than a new phone with a different style of notch, aside from for artistic reasons.

Then it becomes more of an art piece than just a technology.

What capitalism encourages is forcing people to buy new art pieces because they are the "new technology", and "old technology" is outdated.
