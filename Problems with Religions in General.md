I'll use the examples from Islam to highlight this issue:

- We did not send any messenger but (speaking) in the language of his people, so that he might clearly convey the message to them (Quran 14:4).
- And if We had made it a non-Arabic Qur’an, they would have said, “Why are its verses not explained in detail [in our language]? Is it a foreign [recitation] and an Arab [messenger]?” Say, “It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure.” And those who do not believe – in their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. Those are being called from a distant place (Quran 41:44).
- Now if We had willed this [divine writ] to be a discourse in a non-Arabic tongue, they [who now reject it] would surely have said, “Why is it that its messages have not been spelled out clearly?” (Quran 41:44).

As we can see, the language was used by prophet Mohammed to tailor the Quran to the population of Arabia. But now, since they don't want to modify the original word believing in it's superiority, instead of tailoring the Quran to Arabic, they require non-Arabic speakers to learn Arabic.
Now this is not very ideal. Because that would be against the purpose for which Mohammed explained the Quran in Arabic. But can you translate the Quran as it is into other languages? Not really, because the meaning of an idea is closely tied to the language.
For a simple example, we all know how a joke told in one language may not translate well to another language.
