They have not been observed. They were predicted by Dirac and many [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]] models.

- Dirac 
- In GUT theories, early universe would've produced magnetic monopoles. But it is hard to reproduce, and [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] energies are too low for them.
# Implications
Their existence would imply:
- Quantization of all electric charge
- We would be able to catalyse proton decay via the Rubakov-Callan effect.
	- With this, we could get energy from protons using monopoles without using up the monopole itself.
- Other than that technological impact would likely be zero since they are rare.
