They have not been observed.

Their existence would imply:
- Quantization of all electric charge
- We would be able to catalyse proton decay via the Rubakov-Callan effect.
	- With this, we could get energy from protons using monopoles without using up the monopole itself.
- Other than that technological impact would likely be zero since they are rare.

Dyons are other hypothesized particles which have both electric and magnetic monopoles
