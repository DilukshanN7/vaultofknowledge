They have not been observed. They were predicted by Dirac and many [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]] models.

- Dirac proposed magnetic monopoles which would simplify the model of electromagnetism. Dirac monopoles would not fit into the standard model, and would require modifications.
- In GUT theories, early universe would've produced magnetic monopoles. But it is hard to reproduce, and [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] energies are too low for them.

# Studies
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38550994: Discovery of magnetic monopole quasi-particles, which are multiple particles whose combined spin effects generate a monopole on a 2D cross-section. Not a big deal.
# Implications
Their existence would imply:
- Quantization of all electric charge
- We would be able to catalyse proton decay via the Rubakov-Callan effect.
	- With this, we could get energy from protons using monopoles without using up the monopole itself.
- Other than that technological impact would likely be zero since they are rare.
