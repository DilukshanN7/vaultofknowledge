> _Jihad_ is mentioned in four places in the [Qur'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an "Qur'an") as a noun, while its derived verb is used in twenty-four places. _[Mujahid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahid "Mujahid")_, the [active participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_participle "Active participle") meaning "[jihadist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadist "Jihadist")", is mentioned in two verses. In some of these mentions (see [At-Tawbah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-Tawbah "At-Tawbah") 9/41, 44, 81, 86), it is understood that the word _jihad_ directly refers to war, and in others, _jihad_ is used in the sense of "the effort to live in accordance with Allah's will".

>- Jihad by the tongue _(jihad bil lisan)_ (also Jihad by the word, _jihad al-qalam_) is concerned with speaking the truth and spreading the word of Islam with one's tongue.
>- Jihad by the hand _(jihad bil yad)_ refers to choosing to do what is right and to combat injustice and what is wrong with action.
>- Jihad by the sword _(jihad bis saif)_ refers to _qital fi sabilillah_ (armed fighting in the way of God, or holy war), the most common usage by [Salafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi "Salafi") Muslims and offshoots of the [Muslim Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood "Muslim Brotherhood").

Meanwhile, the Islamic Golden Age saw the origin of a specific Hadith that's more rational:

> A related hadith tradition that has "found its way into popular Muslim literature",[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad#cite_note-71) and which has been said to "embody the Muslim mindset" of the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate#Islamic_Golden_Age "Abbasid Caliphate") (the period from the mid-8th century to mid-13th century following the relocation of the [Abbasid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate "Abbasid Caliphate") capital from [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus") to [Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")), is:
