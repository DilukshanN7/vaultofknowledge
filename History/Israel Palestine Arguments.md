###### Why won't Jordan or Egypt take Palestinian refugees from Gaza?
Because once 2.3 million people move to other countries, it will soon result in an unrest, and it'll give more room for Western media to say - look how the Arabs are fighting each other.

Why won't all the European countries take Israelites if they have nowhere else to go?

Same reason.

They want to paint the idea that all Arabs are the same. Then Israel can just Invade Jordan and ask why can't Saudi Arabia take Jordan refugees?
