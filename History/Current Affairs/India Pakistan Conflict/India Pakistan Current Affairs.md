- The Instrument of Accession was signed by the princely states under the Government of India Act of 1935, to ensure that the rulers of the princely states would join one of the two states of India or Pakistan according to the partition plan.
- At the time, Jammu and Kashmir was controlled by Maharaja Hari Singh, who did not want to sign the Instrument of Accession, but Pakistan was convinced that due to the majority of Muslim population, he would join Pakistan, but that didn't happen.
- This angered the Pakistani Government. A few weeks after Independence, they formed a tribal milita, or _lashkar_. On 22 October 1947, they crossed the border of the state. On the way, they looted Baramulla and stalled. Meanwhile, Maharaja called to India for help, and they assisted, with it subject to him having to sign the Instrument of Accession to India.
- In 1948, the fronts solidified until a Line of Control was formed.
- On 23:59 of 31 December 1948, a formal ceasefire was called, and became effective on the night of 1 January 1948.

The real pro

- Pakistan is situated in a water scarce land
- They are afraid that during times of conflict, India may cut off water supply to Pakistan
- Pakistan is expected to go water scarce soon, while India is expected to go scarce by 2050
