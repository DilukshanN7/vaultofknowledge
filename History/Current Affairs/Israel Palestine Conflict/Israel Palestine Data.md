###### 40 Babies were beheaded
- Status: Level 2
- Claim: 40 Babies were beheaded by Hamas
- Proof given: Pictures of blood stained rooms.
- Suspicious data: Some of the stains were pink
- Invalidating Argument: Deoxygenated blood stains won't leave pink stains. No clear proof was given.
	- Israeli citizens say that the requests for actual photos are inhuman, and they often respond with "shame on you" for making such requests.
	- Israel's official social media handle has also posted "shame on you" as part of their awareness campaign.
- Further reports:
	- The reporter who first reported this, said that she heard about it from some IDF soldier.
	- Later IDF denied it had solid reports that babies were killed, and whether any count was taken.
	- Yet Israel's official social media handles have posted this information several times.

###### Rockets launched on the Al-Ahli Arab hospital
- Status: Level 4
- Claim (from Israel): The rockets were a failed launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)
- Claim (from Palestine): The rockets could've only been from Israel
- Proofs Given (from Israel)
	- They've claimed that they analyzed the trajectory of the rockets and found out that it's from the PIJ
	- 
- 
- Personal thoughts:
	- I find it confusing how the misfired rocket managed to hit directly at a hospital, also a few days after Israel asked Hospitals to evacuate.
