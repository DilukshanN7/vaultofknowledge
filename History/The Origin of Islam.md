- Mohammed was a member of the Meccan pagan tribe Banu Quraysh.
- One day he has a revelation.
- 610 AD: He goes to the Cube (Kaaba) of Mecca and presents his revelations
- 622 AD: The polytheist tribe, Banu Quraysh had the Muslims move from Mecca to Medina
- The population of Medina had, alongside the 200 emigrant followers from Mecca, the Faithful of Medina (who gave them accommodation and converted to Islam), Arab pagans, three Jewish tribes and some Christians.



- The Jews of Medina were probably Jews expelled from Roman Palestine.
- While at Medina, according to the Quran, the prophet declared a treaty, "The Constitution of Medina"
	- The contract upheld peace between Jews, Christians (other "People of the Book") and Muslims, defining them all, under given conditions, as the "community" of Medina, and granting all of them freedom of religious thought and practice.
	- **Rights of Non-Muslims according to the constitution:**
		- The security of God is equal for all groups.
		- Non-Muslim members have the same political and cultural rights as Muslims. They have autonomy and freedom of religion.
		- Non-Muslims take up arms against the enemy of the nation and share the cost of war. There is to be no treachery between the two.
		- Non-Muslims are not obliged to take part in the Muslims' religious wars.
- The Three Jewish tribes in Medina were: Banu Qurayza, Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Al-Nadir
- The Terms of the Covenant and their Breach of It (From Quran> surah Al Baqarah 2:84-2:86) [citing the Quran is ok here, since the general argument is that Quran incites violence]
	- Allah criticized the Jews who lived in Al-Madinah (Medina) at the time.
	- They used to suffer, because of the armed conflicts between the tribes Aws and Khazraj
	- Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Al-Nadir were allies of the Khazraj
	- Banu Qurayza used to be the allies of Aws
	- When in war, both tribes would fight for their allies. And during war, they would kill the Arab enemies, and they would also kill Jews who were allies of the other tribe, although the Jews were prohibited from killing each other according to their books.
	- They would also drive each other from their homes and loot all the furniture they could.
	- But at the end of the war, they would release the prisoners of the defeated party, according to the Tawrah.
	- Tawrah said: Do not kill each other, nor expel one another from their homes, nor participate in fighting against them.
	- During the "Battle of Bu'ath", the Jewish tribes would fight among themselves, while the Aws and Khazraj were polytheists who worshipped idols, and did not know about Paradise, the Fire, Resurrection, the Divine Books, the lawful and the prohibited.
	- At the end of the war, they would ransom the prisoners according to the Tawrah, and also ask for blood money.
	- Allah reminded that they ignore the Tawrah when it said you to not kill your members or expel them from their homes, and follow it to implement ransom. By this, they believe one part of the scripture and reject the rest. "You do this all to acquire the life of this world".
	- For this, the 'noble Ayat' criticized the Jews, and said that they must not be trusted to preserve the Torah or to say the truth about the prophet, his coming, his expulsion, etc.
	- On the Day of Resurrection, they will be subject to torment because they defied the book they were given.
- The Terms of the Covenant and their Breach of It (From Quran> surah Al Baqarah 2:87-2:86)
	- The Tawrah was revealed to Musa (Moses), but they distorted it's meaning to fulfil their fantasies
	- So Allah sent Isa (Jesus), and sent miracles to support him, but Jews didn't want to differ from a single word
	- This way, they killed or rejected all Prophets
	- This happened because they altered the Tawrah, and the prophets upheld the truths which clashed with their desires
- 624 AD: Meccans of Banu Quraysh was defeated in the "Battle of Badr"
- Battle of Uhud soon ensued, in which Mohammed was defeated by the Quraysh. After returning to Medina, the Jewish tribes would make fun of him for the defeat.
- A dispute broke up between the Muslims and Banu Qaynuqa
	- It is said that a jeweller from Banu Qaynuqa asked a woman to reveal her hair, and he pinned her dress so when she got up, she was stripped naked. A Muslim man killed the jeweller in retaliation.
		- This story has been debated by many people. Nevertheless, this is the story.
		- Some say that Mohammed decided to eliminate Jews after being strengthened by his victory.
	- Prophet Mohammed warned them to be fair, or else, they'll suffer the same fate as Quraysh. He also asked them to follow the true word of god. But Banu Qaynuqa mocked his followers for accepting him as the prophet and mocked their victory claiming Quraysh had no knowledge of war, and if you fight with us, we'll show you who's boss. So this was seen as a declaration of war.
	- The Banu Qaynuqa tribes were defeated and exiled.
- 625 AD: Banu Nadir tribe was evicted from Medina for trying to assassinate prophet Mohammed.
- 627 AD: Banu Quraysh (of Mecca) and their allies besieged the city of Medina in the "Battle of Trench". Banu Qurayza initially tried to stay neutral, but they entered into negotiations with the besieging army.
	- They dug trenches to keep the Meccans away, so it's called the Battle of the Trench
	- The Meccans came with the support of the other two exiled Jewish tribes, and sent envoys to gain the support of the Banu Qurayza
	- The Banu Qurayza was hesitant, but when a large Meccan army arrived, they joined in
	- Mohammed tried to make diplomatic efforts to keep Banu Qurayza on their side
	- But by the third week, Banu Qurayza decided to act against Mohammed, although they had demanded hostages from the Meccans to ensure they wouldn't be left to face Mohammed alone
	- But they didn't get any hostages because the Meccans were exhausted, and soon cold and heavy rains set in, and the Meccans marched home to the horror and dismay of Banu Qurayza
	- This betrayal was considered a violation of the "Constitution of Medina".
	- The Muslims commenced a 25-day siege against they Banu Qurayza's fortress. Finally both sides agreed to an arbitration.
	- The chosen judge was a former ally of Banu Qurayza, Sa'd ibn Muadh, who was now a Muslim. Sa'd was wounded in battle and would soon die. Though his fellow chiefs asked him to spare their former allies, he decided to kill all of them as they violated the social order and failed to honour the agreement to protect the town.
	- Although Sa'd judged according to his own views, it was consistent with Deuteronomy 20:12-14.
	- They were all beheaded (700 men)
	- This wasn't unusual for the normal behaviour in Arabia at the time. The Muslims were at the threat of extinction and wanted to send this as a message to anyone who would try to betray them in the future. It is not sure that both the parties could've behaved in any other way at the time.
	- Mohammed did not confuse the behaviour of the clans with Judaism
		- As per the Quran, the problem was not Judaism, but Mohammed's belief that they modified the Torah: _We sent down the Torah, in which there is guidance and light, by which the Prophets who surrendered to God's will provided judgments for the Jewish people. Also, the rabbis and doctors of the Law (did likewise), according to that portion of God's Book with which they were entrusted, and they became witnesses to it as wellâ€¦. Whoever does not judge by what God has sent down (including the Torah), they are indeed unbelievers. (5:44)_

- The belief is that in 620 AD, Mohammed was invited by the twelve clans of Medina to be a neutral arbitrator for their entire community, because of continuous wars between clans like the "Battle of Bu'ath".
- They battles proved to them that concepts like an "eye for an eye" doesn't work unless there was one many with authority to judge in such cases.
- Usage of the Eye for an Eye concept (law of reciprocal justice)
	- Use in Babylonian "Code of Hammurabi"
	- Use in Exodus 21:23-27, Leviticus 24:19-20, Deuteronomy 19:21
- The ayahs were revealed during prayer sessions, with the direction of prayer changing from facing Jerusalem to the Kaaba in Mecca during one such session, when the ayahs 2:144, 2:149 and 2:150 were revealed.
- Other Jewish clans who signed the treaty continued to live in peace long after Medina became the capital of Arabia. Some Jewish people converted to Islam, but most people didn't. Theologically, they couldn't accept Mohammed as their messenger, and waited for a prophet to emerge from their own people.
- The exiled Banu Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa later pledged loyalty to Mohammed.
