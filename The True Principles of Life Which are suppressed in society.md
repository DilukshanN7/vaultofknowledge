This is the reason why there isn't any peace in society

- Altruism is seen as weakness or self-hatred
- The ones who do the dirty but essential labour are seen as of lower worth than the ones who do the entertaining or creative level of tasks.
- People who advocate for equal rights are seen as weaklings because they can't hustle enough to be better than the rest, according to the Darwinian nationalism and Judeo-Christian conservativism (where true followers of god are more blessed and the resulting fortune justifies their ways)
- People who care more about someone are seen as less entertaining, for example in the context of love, and hence they are betrayed. Betrayal by someone who one cared for will corrupt people unless they have a high tolerance for suffering and their rationality still values the happiness of other people, and they will join the capitalists and separate themselves from the rest.
- The other people are seen as the "world"
