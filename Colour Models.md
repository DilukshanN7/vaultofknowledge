A colour model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colours can be represented as tuples of numbers (triples in RGB, quadruples in CMYK).

A colour model without a mapping function to a [[colour space]] is a more or less arbitrary colour system with no globally understood system of colour interpretation. Adding a mapping function between a colour model and a reference colour space establishes a definite footprint within the reference colour space, known as [[gamut]].

- Example
- CIE 1931 RGB
- HSL

Generally, [[CIE 1931 Colour Spaces]] are used as reference models for specifying colour models.
