- Camera Selection: https://ocularcomponentmv.blogspot.com/2014/04/machine-vision-lens-and-camera.html

- Lens mount quality
	- CS < M12 < C (best for machine vision)
	- Use C mount for image sensors > 1/8"
	- M12 is suited only for sensors upto 1/8". Cheap M12 are only good upto 1/3". Expensive M12 do not have as much distortion as cheap M12.
	- CS mount is bad for machine vision
