This model was based of the [[CIE 1931 RGB Colour Space]]. This allows representing all hues of the RGB colour space in the X and Y coordinates, with Z being the luminance.

This also solves the problem of [[imaginary colours]] in trichromatic additive spaces like RGB and [[LMS Colour Space|LMS]].

- The gamut of the human eye is not a triangle. (in this colour space?)
