[[Periods of Archaeological History]]

In Geological History, we standardize on the Geological Time Scale.

The definition of standardized international units of geological time is the responsibility of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), a constituent body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). Their primary objective is to precisely define global chronostratigraphic units of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC), which are in turn used to define geochronological units.

The GTS is divided into chronostratigraphic units and their corresponding geochronologic units.

- Chronostraigraphy is a part of stratigraphy. Stratigraphy is the branch of geology concerned with the study of rock layers (strata) and layering (stratification).
- Chronostratigraphy is one of the three subdivisions of stratigraphy (the other two being lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy), dealing with placing an absolute age to rock strata.
