In Geological History, we standardize on the Geological Time Scale.

The definition of standardized international units of geological time is the responsibility of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), a constituent body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). Their primary objective is to precisely define global chronostratigraphic units of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC), which are in turn used to define geochronological units.

The GTS is divided into chronostratigraphic units and their corresponding geochronologic units.

- Chronostraigraphy is a part of stratigraphy. Stratigraphy is the branch of geology concerned with the study of rock layers (strata) and layering (stratification).
- Chronostratigraphy is one of the three subdivisions of stratigraphy (the other two being lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy), dealing with placing an absolute age to rock strata. By placing absolute ages on rock strata, we are able to relate them to their relative formation in time, and hence assign geochronological time periods to them.
- A chronostratigraphic unit is a body of rock, layered or unlayered, that is defined between stratigraphic horizons which represent specified intervals of geologic time. They include all rocks representative of a specific interval of geologic time.
- Geochronology is the branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks, fossils and sediments either through absolute or relative means.
- A geochronological unit is a subdivision of geologic time.

In simple terms, chronostratigraphy obtains the physical evidence, and geost
