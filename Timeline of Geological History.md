[[Periods of Archaeological History]]

In Geological History, we standardize on the Geological Time Scale.

The definition of standardized international units of geological time is the responsibility of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), a constituent body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). Their primary objective is to precisely define global chronostratigraphic unit

The GTS is divided into chronostratigraphic units and their corresponding geochronologic units.
