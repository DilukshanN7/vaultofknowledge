Tenets being:

- Life is a test
- Satan is allowed to tempt
- You can disobey Allah even without Satan
- Allah is just. His promise is only that the next life will be just.
- Allah sent many prophets to show signs, so he cannot be critiqued

Observations:

- Islam is an angry religion as it forces people to be on guard 24/7
- That is true, although the people are in high faith, in fact, they are high on faith

Arguments:

- Why should Allah test instead of just making people's lives easy?
- Why does he demand obedience from people whom he know has desires, and he himself created the ability to feel those desires?
- They say god doesn't tempt, but god is the one who created the ability to be tempted, and also the apparent tempter
- Isn't this entire argument coming from people who cannot find happiness in the difficulties of the existing world? Perhaps if they understood the nature of coexistence, they would understand how to be happy.
- Justice, and complete happiness is fleeting. Heaven is boring. Coexistence, and its uncertainty is what anyone likes.

My faith is based on that the purpose of life is to explore and have fun. Even if there was a god, he would be of the same belief, not a passive-aggressive sadistic narcissist who demands strict obedience from innocent people who have natural desires he himself created. So I wouldn't need to worry about it at all. 

The rest of my words are to guide others to this simple truth.
