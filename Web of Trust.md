Web of trust is a cryptographic system in which follows a decentralized trust model, in contrast to a centralized trust model used in PKI. 

This means that every user will verify one another based on their publicly listed keys.

In the long term, users can rely on a number of trusted introducers such that if all of them claim that the public key belongs to a specific individual, that information is verified. This works based on the concept of emergence, specifically used here for trust.

**Pros**
Flexible: Users can choose
