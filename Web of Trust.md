Web of trust is a cryptographic system in which follows a decentralized trust model, in contrast to a centralized trust model used in PKI. 

This means that every user will verify one another based on their publicly listed keys.

In the long term, users can rely on a number of trusted introducers such that if all of them claim that the public key belongs to a specific individual, that information is verified. In other words, users can send along with their message, two or three attestation verifying their identity, hoping the reciever will have the public key of any of the verifying agencies. This means if A knows B and B knows C, C can send a message to A if B verifies the signature of C

This works based on the concept of emergence, specifically used here for trust.

**Pros**
Flexible: Users can choose
