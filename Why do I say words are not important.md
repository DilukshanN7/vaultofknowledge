You don't always think when making decisions.
You don't think to breathe, nor do you command your digestive systems.
But you can control your breathing by thought, and you can be in touch with your digestive system by staying still.
You may not be able to do too much, but there's also the myths about saints being able to control their energy flows etc. I'm not taking this as fact, but I can see a point to it.

But mainly, you don't always think before doing something. At the simplest level, you have reflexes. But also, sometimes you just place your pencil on the bed, even though you want to keep it on the table.
You may repeat the same mistake several times. So that means you do not always have control over your thoughts.

Often we practice following routines to shape our reflexes. Now that still doesn't address how we react to situations.
Do we always act precisely as we have thought about it?
Many times, we think precisely about the course of action for a long time

So even as so called thinking people, our actions are barely dictated by thought, but when it comes to religion, fear keeps us in check.
Now I'd say it's good to understand consequences to actions and shape our reactions to prevent it, such as learning to not scratch an itch for a long time and tear the skin.
But, thoughts by itself are meaningless, and are simply an attempt to regulate one's feelings. However, it is feelings that regulate the flow of our lives.
All religion does is, hence, align one's feelings to the ways of the religion.

In this manner, the natural feelings are seen as flawed, and are regulated to a single standard.
But I would say the natural feelings are the real way of life, however, it is not conductive to living as a civilization.
Having been in an army school, the natural way of humans is to wear sandals or sneakers outdoors, but it would be improper by the rules of an army school.

The core idea is to establish order in coexistence.
The existence of a god and afterlife was the only way people could find meaning in their lives.
Saying that god will punish one would then make people do 

This can clearly be understood, because a common argument by a faithful person is that god's ways are the true ways, and hence you know deep down that you feel wrong about
whatever you are doing, that isn't allowed by the bible (LGBTQIA+, for example). But the reality is that, the so called wrong feeling is most likely due to the aligning of
the believer's beliefs to the culture which is predominantly religious, and even a non-Christian would feel that way at first due to the culture around them, and because
their parents at a young age taught them certain behaviours were bad.

This is also why many people say that non-religious behaviour is due to parents not disciplining their children, and it is hard to correct them at a later stage, because they
are corrupted beyond repair. But in reality, they are simply free from external influence, and have grown up as natural beings. The only corruption I would say is that members
of a civilized society thinking that natural entities, such as animals, trees, etc. are inferior to the civilized humans. But the truth is that even if humans would understand
their biology and invent new chemical diets and artificial atmosphere, up until now, their very existence was dependent on their natural habitat, on the shoulders of which they
stand on while devaluing it. (That's not to say religions are bad for this, it's more of a problem with civilizations.)



However, I should then say that in reality, this order should be brought about by careful discussion about
