- Exposure Triangle
	- Aperture
	- Shutter Speed
	- ISO
- EV
	- Formula: $EV = \log_2\frac{N^2}{t}$ N = aperture | t = shutter speed 
	- Also $\frac{N^2}{t}=\frac{LS}{K}$ , S = ISO | L = Luminance | K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant

# Tips
- Sunny 16 Rule
	- On a sunny day, if the camera f-number is f/16, then the ISO should be the inverse of shutter speed i.e. if the shutter speed is 1/100, ISO should be 100 and if it is 1/200, ISO should be 200, etc.
	- This results in an EV of 14.646
