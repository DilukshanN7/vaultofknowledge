Judaism, Christianity and Islam



Judaism: Hated by Christians, Forced into inventing capitalism


Britain: Christians arrived in India, Hated Jews initially, Started institutions after independence


Islam: Strict from the start, Against America's interests of lavish freedom to do anything, Seen as terrorists after 9/11

America: Was neutral and capitalist, took in the Jews during the genocide, and allied with their ways, backed Israel
