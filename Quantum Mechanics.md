# Shortcomings

- "God does not play dice" - Einstein
- Is the electron a probability wave ($\psi^*\psi$), or is it the orbital itself ($\psi$)?
- It could be that the wave is vibrating in 4D space, like a string is vibrating in 2D space.
	- These theories are grouped under the "Hidden Variable Theory"
		- e.g. Pilot Wave Theory (or de Broglie-Bohm Theory)
			- Has hydrodynamic analogues
		- The problem with most hidden variable theories is that when you try to write a Lagrangian for such a system, you aren't able to incorporate the Lorentz Invariant to start with.
