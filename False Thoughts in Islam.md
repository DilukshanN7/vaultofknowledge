# The claim that music is unlawful

“Whoever says that all music is prohibited, let him also claim that the songs of the birds are prohibited”- Abu Hamed Al Gazzali

The Quran makes no mention of music being forbidden; rather, it says:

“You shall not utter lies with your own tongues stating: "This is Halal (lawful), and this is Haram (unlawful)," to fabricate lies and attribute them to GOD. Surely, those who fabricate lies and attribute them to GOD will never succeed” (Al Quran #16:116).
