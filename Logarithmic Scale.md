It is a scale where values are plotted by their logarithmic values. This is commonly used to display values with a large variation in data, such as exponential growths. A logarithmic graph is non-linear.

	- For sound in air, the decibel scale measures the sound pressure level (SPL) relative to an air pressure of $\text{20 }\micro\text{Pa}$, which is approximately the sound of a mosquito flying 3 metres away, which is considered the threshold of human hearing.
	- Sound Intensity Level (SIL) is different, and varies according to the room conditions. The human auditory threshold has an SIL of 0.98 $pW/m^2$ at 1 atmosp
	- SIL can be related to SPL by the specific acoustic impedance value $\text{z}_0$, At ambient temperature, $\text{z}_0$ = 410 Pa-s/m, and therefore the reference value $\text{I}_0$ = 1 $pW/m^2$.
