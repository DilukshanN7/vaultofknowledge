When hungry eat, when tired sleep.

To function as a society, if we eat at specific times, we tend to sleep at specific times as well.
To eat, we must obtain food. Food tastes better, and is healthier when cooked.
For cooking food, we must obtain the ingredients.

The ingredients are either manufactured by plants, or taken in by consuming secondary consumers.

Plants can be homegrown or be outsourced. There are public spots like forests as well as privately owned farms. Animals can be homegrown, but we generally do not do it for the sake of consumption. They can also be hunted or be outsourced from other people.
