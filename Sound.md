Sound is a wave that propagates through a physical medium by pushing on other particles in the medium. Every wave has a frequency and a wavelength, which are related by the speed of the wave. Since waves propagate by pushing on neighbouring particles, the speed of the wave is dependent on the elastic and inertial properties of the medium.

Speed of Sound = $\sqrt{\text{(elastic properties) / (inertial properties)}}$
## Speed of sound in various media
- For a string: $v=F_T/\mu$, where $F_T$ is the tension in the string and $\mu$ is the linear density.  
- For a solid medium: $v=Y/\rho$, where $Y$ is the Young's modulus and $\rho$ is the density.
- For a liquid medium: $v=B/\rho$, where $B$ is the Bulk modulus and $\rho$ is the density.
- For an ideal gas: $v=\gamma RT/M$, where $\gamma$$R$$T$$M$
