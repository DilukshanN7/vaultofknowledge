Speed of Sound = $\sqrt{\text{(elastic properties) / (inertial properties)}}$

- For a string: $v=F_T/\mu$, where $F_T$ is the tension in the string and $\mu$ is the linear density.  
- For a solid medium: $v=Y/\rho$, where $Y$ is the Young's modulus and $\rho$ is the density.
- For a liquid medium: $v=B/\rho$, where $B$ is the Bulk modulus and $\rho$ is the density.
- For an ideal gas:
