There are many, but I'll name just a few I'm familiar with:
- Indo-European
	- Pre-Anatolian (4200 BC)
		- Hittite (Earliest recorded Indo-European Language)
	- Pre-Tocharian (3700 BC)
	- Pre-Germanic (3300 BC)
	- Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (3000 BC)
	- Pre-Armenian (2800 BC)
	- Pre-Balto-Slavic (2800 BC)
	- Pre-Greek (2500 BC)
	- Proto-Indo-Iranian (2200 BC)
	- Evolution From Then
		- 1500 - 1000 BC
			- Pre-Proto-Germanic develops in Scandinavia during Nordic Bronze Age
			- Pre-Proto-Celtic Urnfield and Hallstatt cultures emerge in Central Europe, introducing the Iron Age
			- Indo-Aryans move to India and start the Vedic Age and the Iron Age in Punjab
			- Proto-Italic speakers move to the Italian peninsula
			- Hittites go extinct
			- Mycenaean civilization makes way for Greek Dark Ages
			- Iranian speakers start migrating towards Greater Iran
			- Balto-Slavic splits into Baltic and Slavic
		- 1000 - 500 BC
			- Celtic Languages spread to Central and Western Europe, including Britain
			- Baltic languages were spoken in modern day Poland to Moscow
			- Indo-Aryan tongue reaches eastwards to a broader Mahajanapadas, giving rise to Greater Magadha cultural sphere, where Mahavira preaches Jainism and Gautama Buddha preaches Buddhism.
			- In Iran, Zoroaster composes Gathas.
			- Pre-Proto-Germanic gives rise to Proto-Germanic in Scandinavia
			- Achaemenid Empire replaces the Elamites and Babylonia
			- Proto-Italic splits into Osco-Umbrian, Latin-Faliscan, and possibly Venetic and Siculian
			- Some Indo-Aryan speakers move to Sri Lanka and Maldives
		- 500 BC – 1 BC/AD
			- Classical Antiquity: spread of Greek and Latin throughout the Mediterranean and, during the Hellenistic period (Indo-Greeks), to Central Asia and the Hindukush
			- The Magadhan power and influence rises in ancient India, especially with the conquests of the Nandan and Mauryan empires.
			- Germanic speakers start migrating southwards to occupy formerly Celtic territories.
			- Scythian cultures extend from Eastern Europe (Pontic Scythians) to Northwest China (Ordos culture).
		- 1 BC – AD 500
		- Late Antiquity, Gupta period; attestation of Armenian.
		- Proto-Slavic emerges
		- The Roman Empire and then the Germanic migrations marginalize the Celtic languages to the British Isles. Sogdian, an eastern Iranian language, becomes the lingua franca of the Silk Road in Central Asia leading to China, due to the proliferation of Sogdian merchants there. Greek settlements and Byzantine rule make the last Anatolian languages extinct. Turkic languages start replacing Scythian languages.
500–1000: Early Middle Ages. The Viking Age forms an Old Norse koine spanning Scandinavia, the British Isles and Iceland. Phrygian becomes extinct. The Islamic conquests and the Turkic expansion result in the Arabization and Turkification of significant areas where Indo-European languages were spoken, but Persian still develops under Islamic rule and extends into Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Due to further Turkic migrations, Tocharian becomes fully extinct while Scythian languages are overwhelmingly replaced. Slavic languages spread over wide areas in central, eastern and southeastern Europe, largely replacing Romance in the Balkans (with the exception of Romanian) and whatever was left of the Paleo-Balkan languages with the exception of Albanian. Pannonian Basin is taken by the Magyars from the western Slavs.
1000–1500: Late Middle Ages: Attestation of Albanian and Baltic. Modern dialects of Indo-European languages start emerging.
1500–2000: Early Modern period to present: Colonialism results in the spread of Indo-European languages to every habitable continent, most notably Romance (North, Central and South America, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia), West Germanic (English in North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and Australia; to a lesser extent Dutch and German), and Russian to Central Asia and North Asia.
