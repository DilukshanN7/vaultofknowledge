If I recall the way my mom taught me to write when I was two or three, I first learned to write using rice in a bowl. She would make me write the first letter, and map it to the corresponding sound, the next letter, and so on. As for speaking, this was taught in the same manner as I learned emotes. So it was like "sha", then combinations "shan", and so on. In that way, I started to learn to read, by translating those words into sounds and sounds into meaning. Later on it would become second nature for me to translate the words into meaning without referring back to sounds. In any case, the sounds or letters were not the sources of meaning, they were only the methods of communication, for a meaning that existed beyond it. Because even before I knew any words, I knew the meaning of events, because I could feel them.


# Forms of writing
- Pictorial writing system
	- Mnemonics: Marks for remembrance
	- Pictographic: Glyphs directly represent an object or concept
	- Ideographic: Graphemes are abstract symbols that directly represent an idea or concept
- Transitional system: Graphemes refer not only to an idea, but its name as well
- Phonetic: Graphemes refer to sounds or spoken symbols, and the form of grapheme is not related to its meaning.
	- Verbal: Grapheme represents a whole word
	- Syllabic: Grapheme represents a syllable
	- Alphabetic: Grapheme represents an elementary sound
