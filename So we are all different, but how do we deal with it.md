I used to have a theory that one must treat both a man and a woman the same, because they both are human beings in the end, and their feelings are the same.

But repeated sequences of evidences suggest that it's not the same. Men and women have aside from physical and chemical differences, also have differences in psychological responses, particularly with regard to natural behaviour.

I'm aware of the ways in which culture shapes men and women, but I'm talking about it beyond that.

For example, women are more inclined to pursue romantic relationships and sex than men, and this is not merely because society views women as more beautiful and they just get more chances. But it's also because of physical differences whereby a women does not get tired after sex, and only gets more pleasure from it. ***(Note that I'm not saying that men are not interested in sex as much as women, I'm just saying that when they do, they do it more as, to use the common term, "fuckboys", rather than as true romantic partners. The distinction becomes more clear further in this page.)***

For this reason, men are likely to get more attached to a single woman, while women are capable of (important warning to not take this statement out of context) handling multiple relationships easily. That doesn't mean they will, however, but after the usual teenage angst periods, many people usually turn to bad behaviour. This often means for women, a period of going through relationships without taking any time to see the problems from the other side and siding with the opinion that all men are by birth, "terrible, useless or incompatible", or "trash".

For men, this would mean the same toxic behaviour, but it's not because they don't think the women are problem makers, it's just that they never see them as anything more than a "tool for sex", or a "piece of meat".

Of course, both men and women do see their partners as both "trash" and as a "piece of meat", but the difference lies in what they are generally inclined to. You often see women saying men are "trash" than that they are "pieces of meat", and men saying that women are "pieces of meat" that that they are "trash". Now this, I believe is something we can agree upon, and that's what this article is
