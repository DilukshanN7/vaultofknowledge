The von Kries chromatic adaptaton method is a technique that is sometimes used in camera image processing. The method is to apply a gain to each of the human cone cell spectral sensitivity responses so as to keep the adapted appearance of the reference white constant.

von Kries transform is defined for the [LMS Colour Space](LMS%20Colour%20Space.md).
The more complete von Kries transform, used for colours in the [XYZ](CIE%201931%20XYZ%20Colour%20Space.md) or [RGB](RGB%20Colour%20Spaces.md) colour spaces includes matrix transformations into and out of the [LMS space](LMS%20Colour%20Space.md).
