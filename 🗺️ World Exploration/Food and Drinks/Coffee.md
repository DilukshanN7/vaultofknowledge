# Ingredients

**Note:** What's on the market maybe pre-grounded coffee, and I found that most are not either Arabica or Robusta, but rather a mix of both. Starbucks does the same thing, but with better descriptions.
## Coffee Beans
- Arabica Coffee Beans (Smooth, Less Bitter)
- Robusta Coffee Beans (Strong, Caffeine-Rich)
### Available as
- Whole Beans (Unroasted / Roasted to a degree)
- Ground Coffee
- Instant Coffee (Soluble, extracted after brewing and evaporating water)
## Syrup
# Equipment
### Brewing Machine
- French Press (For flavour-rich cup of coffee)
- Espresso Machine (For espressos)

- Moka Pot (Italian, higher pressure than drip coffee)

> [!NOTE]
> Most countries either pour hot water over filter or percolate, but in India we add coffee to hot water, then filter and then percolate for uniformly distributing the taste.
