# Dressing
Both men and women are required to dress modestly under Islam. But what it means for a woman to dress modestly is highly subjective, and these rules are often very oppressive towards women. Islam in particular is known to be very strict with its women followers.

> [!NOTE]
> Regarding the rule for women having to wear veils, in the olden times it was seen as a mark of respect aside from protection, in the same manner all three Abrahamic religions refuse to look at or draw images of god, because that is somehow seen as a sign of great respect.
> 
> In the modern day, this is obviously misused in oppressive regimes. Nowadays it is seen as disrespect to force women to cover their faces with a veil, and even Muslims have started not wearing burqas. However, Quran does demand men and women to dress modestly, rather than provocatively. While that is pretty reasonable, any sort of punishment or specific definitions to what is modest is not reasonable. I would say that here is the importance of seeing religion as the feeling of an individual becomes important (See my [[Defining Religion|defintion of religion]]).
> 
> Also, hijabs and burqas not only the only form of modest coverings, there are others too.
