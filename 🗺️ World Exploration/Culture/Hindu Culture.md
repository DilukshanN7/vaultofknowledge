Hindus subscribe to a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but have no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.
## Types of Hinduism
- Folk Hinduism, based on local traditions and cults of local deities prior to the Vedic Age
- Shrauta or "Vedic" Hinduism as practised by traditionalist brahmins
- Vedantic Hinduism, including Advaita Vedanta (Smartism), based on the philosophical approach of the Upanishads
- Yogic Hinduism, especially the sect based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
- "Dharmic" Hinduism or "daily morality", based on Karma and upon societal norms such as VivƒÅha (Hindu marriage customs)
- Bhakti or devotionalist practices

## Caste Divisions / Chatur Varnas
- Brahmins
- Kshathriyas
- Vaishyas
- Shudras
- Untouchables (Casteless)

The religious theory states that according to the Rig Veda (ancient Hindu book) the Adipurush (primal man) destroyed himself to create a society where the different parts of his body represented the four Varnas. Brahmins came from his head, Kshatriyas came from his hands, Vaishyas came from his thighs, and Sudras came from his feet.

## Eight Types of Marriages

These are in the order of superiority.

- **Brahma Vivaha**: According to dharma sindhu, yogya vadhu varu vivaha is termed as Brahama Vivaha. The bride and groom belong to the same varna. Groom follows the brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and Sanyasa ashrams according to the laws of dharma. The groom's father approaches the girls family and requests the bride's father for his consent to give her as a gift (kanyadaan). This is considered as the best type of marriage.
- **Daiva Vivaha**: In this type of marriage, the father of the bride after having waited long for a marriage proposal for his daughter, goes in search of a right groom and gifts his daughter to a righteous Ritvik (priest) who officiates a yagna if the latter is willing to accept her as a wife.
- **Arsha Vivaha**: In this type of marriage, the father of the bride offers his daughter to a Rishi or a sage who leads an austere life. The wife accompanies the sage in his austerities and penance. According to Srimad Bhagavatha, Manu performed Arsha vivaha of his daughter Devahuti to sage Kardama, who later begot Kapila, an avatar of Vishnu.
- **Prajapatya Vivaha**: In this type of marriage, Bride's father goes in search for the groom. After marriage, the bride lives with the husband through the stages of Grihasthya and Vanaprastha and the husband should not take to Sanyasa. Emphasis is laid on continuing the family lineage by begetting sons and daughters. Most of the arranged marriages that we witness today belong to this category.
- **Gandharva Vivaha**: A love marriage, in which the bride and groom get married based on mutual consent without any other considerations. This is considered inferior than the above forms of marriages.
- **Asura Vivaha**: In this type of marriage, lack of consent from either sides, is replaced by compensation with money or in the form of dowry or gift. This type of marriage is like a business transaction. Mostly, the groom is not suitable for the girl and might offer a huge sum of money as a compensation.
- **Rakshasa Vivaha**: Groom has the bride's consent but not the consent of the girl's family. To marry a woman by abduction or by eloping, against the wishes of the parent is Rakshasa vivaha. The groom may also win over the bride's family in a battleground.
- **Paisachika Vivah**: This is considered as the most inferior type of marriage as the bride is taken away by force as a wife. In this type of marriage, neither the girl's consent nor the family's consent is honored.
