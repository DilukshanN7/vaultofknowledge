Simplicity and Automation are key to a strong development team

Think of writing tests as an investment in the future
"Writing tests is kind of an art" - settle for 80% coverage, not 100%

**Aspects**
- Microservices
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Policy as Code (PaC)
- Monitoring
**SecOps**
"Keep Security Left"
- Security as Code (SaC) - on IaC
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
- Threat Modelling
- Automated Security Testing
- Incident Management
- Security Testing Methods - SAST, IAST, DAST, RAST (?)

**Methodologies**
- Test Driven Development
	- Refers to the practice in XP of writing tests before the code.
	- Any code is written after a test is written.
- Behaviour Driven Development
	- Extension to TDD, where behaviours, instead of tests are written by users or testers.
	- The tests are written in a simple language like Gherkin, which is automatically converted to scripts.
	- Allows collaboration of developers, testers and business owners
