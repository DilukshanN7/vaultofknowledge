# Decision
For our purposes, we'll be considering only Kanban and Scrum

- Communication
	- Slack/Discord (Sync)
	- E-Mail/Trello (Async)
	- Notion/Confluence (Docs)

* Could split some teams into [[Agile]], where it fits (eg: software)

* Incorporate healthy workplace habits like:
- 20-20-20 rule
- Ergonomic screens and furniture
- Pomodoro technique
- Stretching exercises
- Refreshment breaks
- Follow procedure under stress



## Using Scrum Methodology
(Adjusted for our workflow)

- Sprint Planning + Backlog pruning - Monday
- Sprint Review - Wednesday
- Sprint Retrospective - Friday
## Reasons for Absences
* Personal vacations
* Holidays
* Other personal projects
* Flexibility in all that

* Mental health breaks
