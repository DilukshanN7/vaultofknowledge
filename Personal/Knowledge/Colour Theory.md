### Colour Perception
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision
#### Physiology
- Light sensitivity
- Rod and Cone Cells
	- Cone Cells
		- Are three types - Short (S), Medium (M), Long (L)
		- Gives colour vision
		- Most are sensitive to 555 nm (Green)
	- Rod Cells
		- Gives low-light vision at 500 nm
#### Mathematics
- Physical color is a combination of pure spectral colours (in the visible range)
- Hilbert Spaces (Infinite Dimensional Vector Space)
- Euclidian Spaces
