	- This clip shows a woman explaining why she joined Islam
	- She quoted a verse that said the life of this world is meaningless
	- She said she was seeking god in all the wrong places, such as seeking likes and followers, and posting fitness modelling.

		- She mentions "fitness modelling" just like that she was, on purpose sexually projecting herself in the name of feminist freedom, and expecting it to be what's the right way of life.
		- I'm not saying in the slightest manner that fitness modelling is bad. Not even in the slightest. I'm saying that people do other thing
