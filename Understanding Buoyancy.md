- If the bottom has no pressure to form a difference, there is no buoyancy. For example, in suction cups.
- But why is the water at the bottom pushing upwards?
	- Pressure is the volumetric energy of the particles in the fluid
	- Technically, you can apply this to solids too, as energy per unit volume is the normal force per unit area.
