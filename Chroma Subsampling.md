It is the practice of encoding images by implementing less resolution for [chroma](World%20Building/Science%20and%20Engineering/Mathematics/Applied%20Mathematics/Digital%20Signal%20Processing/Digital%20Image%20Processing/Chrominance.md) information than for [Luma](World%20Building/Science%20and%20Engineering/Mathematics/Applied%20Mathematics/Digital%20Signal%20Processing/Digital%20Image%20Processing/Luma.md) information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for colour differences than for luminance.

It is used in many video and still image encoding schemes - both analog and digital - including in [JPEG](World%20Building/Science%20and%20Engineering/Mathematics/Applied%20Mathematics/Digital%20Signal%20Processing/Digital%20Image%20Processing/JPEG.md) encoding.
