It is the practice of encoding images by implementing less resolution for [[chrominance|chroma]] information than for [[luma]] information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for colour differences than for luminance.

It is used in many video and still image encoding schemes - both analog and digital - including in [[JPEG]] encoding.
