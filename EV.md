Formula: $EV = \log_2\frac{N^2}{t}$ N = aperture | t = shutter speed 

- Also $\frac{N^2}{t}=\frac{LS}{K}$ , S = ISO | L = Luminance | K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant
- The calculators for EV Equivalence used the formula $EV=\log_2{\frac{100N^2}{St}}$ 

> I observed that for my smartphone with fixed aperture (f/1.79) and Shutter Speed and ISO set to Auto, when EV was set to +4.0, the ISO varied from 12799 to ~2000 as light increased, while the shutter speed remained at 1/14. 

- Equivalent EV doesn't always result in the same image
	- e.g. Shutter speed can be slower causing water to have a ribbon like effect
	- e.g. Aperture can be adjusted to have a shallow/deeper depth of field (DoF)
