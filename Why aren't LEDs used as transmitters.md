6G is entering the THz range.

But 4THz is the beginning of visible spectrum!

We have IR LEDs, IR sensors, Visible LEDs and Visible Cameras.
What does 6G, or 7G mean for these?

My guess is that LEDs are diffuse radiators with a mix of frequencies, and hence they are not ideal for modulation.
And I would guess IR LEDs are used as remote controllers by intensity modulation within a pretty large margin of error.
How many controls do we realistically expect a TV to have anyways? This would also explain why remotes go out of range very quickly (aside from the fact that IR light is easily susceptible to obstruction).

Also, well, Li-Fi is a thing. And, Morse code using light, is nothing but flickering it completely on and off, like 1s and 0s. We can do a lot better than that using varying intensities, even in a way that human's can't recognize.

Ahh, here I see the problem of using cameras. They just measure the intensity of light to a good approximation for optical vision. They struggle at differentiating different levels of lightness, especially visible in low light conditions. So we don't have the transceiver technology for light that is modulated in any other way than by the intensity. This is also why AM is easier than FM and it is less prone to obstructions than FM, but is more prone to interference than FM.

This is partly because AM uses longer wavelengths and omnidirectional antennas, while FM antennas are usually directional and has shorter wavelengths. To account for good bandwidth, FM uses UHF or VHF bands to have many frequency channels, while AM uses SW, MW or LW bands.

But, the range is only affected by the frequency of the carrier wave, not the modulation used. It's just that the higher the frequency, more the possible bandwidth of the modulated signal. Now, for a given bandwidth, the data rate depends on the specific modulation used. That is a part of digital communications and signal processing.

Fun fact: LEDs are used as transmitters and detectors too. This was invented by Forrest Mimms.
