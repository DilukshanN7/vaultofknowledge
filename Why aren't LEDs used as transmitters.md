6G is entering the THz range.

But 4THz is the beginning of visible spectrum!

We have IR LEDs, IR sensors, Visible LEDs and Visible Cameras.
What does 6G, or 7G mean for these?

My guess is that LEDs are diffuse radiators with a mix of frequencies, and hence they are not ideal for modulation.
And I would guess IR LEDs are used as remote controllers by intensity modulation within a pretty large margin of error.
How many controls do we realistically expect a TV to have anyways? This would also explain why remotes go out of range very quickly (aside from the fact that IR light is easily susceptible to obstruction).

Also, well, Li-Fi is a thing. And, Morse code using light, is nothing but flickering it completely on and off, like 1s and 0s. We can do a lot better than that using remotes

Fun fact: LEDs are used as transmitters and detectors too. This was invented by Forrest Mimms.
