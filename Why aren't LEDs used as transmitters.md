6G is entering the THz range.

But 4THz is the beginning of visible spectrum!

We have IR LEDs, IR sensors, Visible LEDs and Visible Cameras.
What does 6G, or 7G mean for these?

My guess is that LEDs are diffuse radiators with a mix of frequencies, and hence they are not ideal for modulation.
And I would guess IR LEDs are used as remote controllers by intensity modulation within a pretty large margin of error.
