Natural frequency or [[Eigenvalues|eigenfrequency]] is the frequency at which a system tends to oscillate in the absence of any driving force.

The motion pattern of a system oscillating at its natural frequency is called the normal mode (if all parts of the system move sinusoidally with that same frequency).

If the oscillating system is driven by an external force at the frequency at which the amplitude of its motion is greatest (close to a natural frequency of the system), this frequency is called the [[Resonance|resonant frequency]].
# Values
For a single degree of freedom oscillator, like a mass-spring system, the natural frequency of oscillation depends on two quantities: mass and stiffness (provided the system is undamped)

$\large \omega_0 = \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}$,

where:
$\large k$ is the stiffness of the string
$\large m$ is the mass of the body
$\large \omega_0$ is the natural frequency in rad/s

In [[modal analysis]], the frequency of  the 1st mode is the fundamental frequency.
This is also expressed as:

$\large f_0 = \dfrac{1}{2l} \sqrt{\dfrac{T}{\mu}}$,

where:
$\large f_0$
$\large l$
$\large \mu$
$\large T$
