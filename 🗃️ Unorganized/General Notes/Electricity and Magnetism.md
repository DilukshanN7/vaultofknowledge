- Changing electric field produces a magnetic field and vice versa.
- To do that, we have to accelerate a charge carrier, which are the only things through which we can alter the field.
- We can also move magnets, which are aggregates of moving electrons producing a magnetic field.
- That is, we can only move charge carriers or aggregates of charge carriers, and we only have charge carriers for the electric field, but not 
- Changing acceleration of a charge carrier produces a change in the change of an electric field.
