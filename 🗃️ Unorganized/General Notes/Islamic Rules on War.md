# Truth
- 1. Don't Cut a Tree
	- Personal Comment
		- It's a joke without qualification
	- During Siege of Banu Nadir
		- "...Whatever you have cut down of [their] palm trees or left standing on their trunks - it was by permission of Allah and so He would disgrace the defiantly disobedient..." **(Qur'an Surah 59)**
		- "...The Prophet gathered his forces and marched to the area of Bani An-Nadir...The Messenger ordered their date trees be cut down and burned. The Jews heralded at the Prophet, O Muhammad! You used to forbid mischief in the earth and blame those who did it. Why is it that you had the date trees cut down and burned..." **(Tafsir ibn Katheer)**
- 2. Don't kill children
	- The Islamic definition of an adult is a person who that had their first wet dream or period, or produced pubic hair.
	- That will include some as young as 10-12 years old.
	- Muhammad authorised the beheading of all boys with pubic hair after the Banu Qurayza surrendered.
- 3. Don't kill old people
	- It is reported from Islamic scripture that Muhammad permitted the killing of Abu Afak, an old man, for writing poetry critical of Muhammad and Islam.
- 4. Don't destroy a church, temple or building
	- 'Dhul Khalasa' was a temple, known as the southern Ka’ba, to rival the Ka’ba at Mecca, so Muhammad ordered its demolition. Jarir ibn Abdullah al-Bajali was sent to demolish it. Not to forget Muhammad destroyed the sacred idols of the Meccans.
- 5. Don't kill those who surrendered
	- Muhammad permitted the mass execution of the adult men of the Banu Qurayza after they surrendered.
- 6. Don't kill who ran away
	- The Quran says to pursue your enemy. vigorously, "...And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful." (**Qur'an 9:5**)
- 7. Don't kill a woman
	- There are reports in Islamic scripture that detail the killing of women, including political assassinations ordered by Muhammad, most notably the killing of 'Fartana' and 'Quraybah' - (slave girls of Abdullah ibn Khatal) merely because they recited poems insulting Muhammad (a man with revelations insulting various people and adherents of other religions).
	- Also the man who killed the slave girl whom he had two children with for insulting Mohammed
- 8. Don't kill a sick person or priest
	- Hard to believe that when he executed every adult male of the surrendered Banu Qurayza, there were no clerics or sick person amongst them - especially after confronting the Muslims and knowing their fate of death.
- 9. Don't disfigure the dead
	- Right, just do it when they're alive. There are reports in Islamic scripture of Muhammad permitting execution via stoning, beheading and flogging, this certainly constitutes as disfiguring not just those alive, but to an extent the dead too, atleast in such cases as beheading and execution via stoning.
	- Not to forget from Tafsir al-Jalalayn, "After Hamza [b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib] had been killed and mutilated, and the Prophet (s) had seen him and said, ‘Verily I will mutilate 70 of them for you’, the following was revealed: And if you retaliate, retaliate with the like of what you have been made to suffer; and yet if you endure patiently, [refraining] from revenge, verily that, namely, [that] enduring, is better for the patient. Thus the Prophet (s) refrained [from taking revenge] and made atonement for his oath, as reported by al-Bazzār."[3]

    Treat prisoners well

As already stated Muhammad permitted the mass execution of the adult men of the surrendered Banu Qurayza. Prisoners by the way can be ransomed and enslaved (as occurred to the women and children of the Banu Qurayza), neither which Muhammad prohibited and are illegal under the Geneva conventions and international law.

    don't enforce Islam

"...And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah . And if they cease - then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do..."[4]

"The Messenger of Allah said, (I was commanded to fight against the people until they proclaim, `There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.' If and when they say it, they will preserve their blood and wealth from me, except for its right (Islamic penal code), and their reckoning is with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.)"[5]

Let's also not forget Islamic scripture has historically been used to justify the persecution of apostates and blasphemers, coercing individuals to Islam.

Briefly, a text as ambiguous and contradictory as the Quran, is open to a range of interpretations, but each subjective interpretation has its own justification. Those with an agenda of violent expansionism and intolerance of those not of their creed (example, ISIS) will claim that their interpretation is 'true islam' and will find (or cherry pick) verses and justifications within Islamic scripture for that. While other competing (more peaceful and tolerant) interpretations will similarly do the same with their 'peaceful' and 'tolerant' agenda.[
