## Backup Utilities
- NANDroid Backup (Only backups system and app data)
	- e.g. TWRP Backup, OFRP Backup
	- NANDroid backups are dead, since the introduction of forced encryption (FBE and FDE) since Android 7.0 Nougat, and it is forced on since Android 10
		- Now after a factory reset, there is no way to decrypt the backup
	- Some implementations in TWRP and OFRP can still do this in Android 13 and 14
- Titanium Backup
- Neo Backup
