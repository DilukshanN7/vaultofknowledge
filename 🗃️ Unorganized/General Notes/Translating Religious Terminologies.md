# Outline form (abandoned)
**Template:** `'Word in Transliterated Form' '(Meaning / Definition)' [(Description in)] [(Reference)]` (last two can skip preceding optional elements)

- Bible (The Authoritative Texts from God according to Those Who Believe in Jesus as the Son of Lord, Lord Himself and Saviour) (Bible intrinsically means it is from the Christians)
- TaNaKh (TePrWr, an Abbreviation for Teaching, Prophets and Writings)
- Torah (Teaching) (Contains the the Divine Teaching revealed by Moses) (intrinsically is a Yehudi Text)
- Nevi'im (Prophets) (Contains the Sayings of The Prophets) (intrinsically is a Yehudi Text)

At this point, I realized the outline form is hard to represent, so I decided to fill the table instead.
# Table Form
Sorted by: Language, Primary Context, Word (So that words can be easily found from context)
Represented Order: Language, Word, Primary Context (Because we look mainly for words, not by context)
