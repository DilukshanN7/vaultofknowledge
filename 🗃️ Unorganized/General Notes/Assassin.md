It comes from the French/Italian word Assassini, which comes from the Arabic word Hashshashin.

It referred to a group of Nazari Isma'eeli Shi'a Mohammedan Muslims who were called The Order of the Assassins.

Only a set of disciples called the Fedayeen actually involved in fights.

# Origin of the Word
"Asas" means "principles" in Arabic. "Asaasiyyoon" meant "People of Principles". "Hashshashin" was probably a play on the word "Assaasiyyoon" (not "Assaassiyyeen", the plural of "Asasi", meaning Fundamental).

"Hashshashin" means "hashish users". Hashish is a tobacco based drug.

The term Assassin was introduced to Europe by Marco Polo.

19th century orientalist Silvestre de Sacy was the first to link the etymology of Assassin to Hashih using the variants "assassin" and "assassini". He used 13th century historial Abu Shama's record to do so.

Self-proclaimed Sufi scholar Idriesh Shah (who didn't belong to any Sufi Tariqa or graduated from any university) continued to pejoratively affirm that the Assassins, and Isma'eelis in general were druggers who used hashih to stupefy candidates for sending them to paradise.


In reality, the term Hashishi was first used back in 1122 during the fall of the Fatimid Khilafat, by Kalifa al-Amir bi-Ahkami'llah to pejoratively describe his enemies. He was assassinated.


Without actually accusing the group of using the hashish drug, the caliph used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly adopted by anti-Isma'ili historians and applied to the Isma'ilis of Syria and Persia. The spread of the term was further facilitated through military encounters, whose chroniclers adopted the term and disseminated it across Europe. To Crusaders, the Fedayeen concept of valuing a principle above your own life was alien to them, so they rationalized it using myths such as the 'paradise legend', the 'leap of faith' legend, and the 'hashish legend', sewn together in the writings of Marco Polo.[89]
