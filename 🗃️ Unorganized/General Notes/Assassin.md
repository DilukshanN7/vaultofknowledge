It comes from the French/Italian word Assassini, which comes from the Arabic word Hashshashin.

It referred to a group of Nazari Isma'eeli Shi'a Mohammedan Muslims who were called The Order of the Assassins.

Only a set of disciples called the Fedayeen actually involved in fights.
# Origin of the Word
"Asaasa" means "principles" in Arabic. "Asaasiyyoon" meant "People of Principles". "Hashshashin" was probably a play on the word "Asaasiyyoon"
