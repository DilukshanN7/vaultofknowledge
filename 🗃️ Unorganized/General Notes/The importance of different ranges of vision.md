- Humans have a set visible range
- Other living beings, like bees have UV vision
- The atmosphere scatters frequencies of high energy
- Blue light is what we primarily see as scattered, although UV is also scattered in the lower ranges of the atmosphere
- Other high energy radiation may exist in the outer atmosphere
- Ozone layer absorbs a lot of the UV radiation and protects the Earth.
