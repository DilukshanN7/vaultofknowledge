# Metaphysics Joke

Claim: "Hindus worship the creation and not the creator"

Fix: These Muslims have to be taught some metaphysics.


- Dualism
	- God is Separate from the Universe (And is Jealous)
	- God is Separate from the Universe (And is not Jealous)
	- God is Separate from the Universe (And has left it)
	- Multiple Gods Exist (And people respect all of them)
	- Multiple Gods Exist (And people worship one of them)
	- God has created Gods to Manage Realities
- Monism
	- Everything is God (And God is Active)
	- Everything is God (And God is Inactive)
- Between Monism and Dualism
	- Everything is a Part of God
	- We Cannot Know the Difference Between God and Nature
