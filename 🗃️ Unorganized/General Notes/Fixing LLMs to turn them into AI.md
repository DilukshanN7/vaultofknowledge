Image Classifiers are AI. They identify and classify objects.
However, LLMs are not.

LLMs play only with languages.
They do not deal with epistemology and connecting language to ideas.

So they can be used to convert written ideas to more easily digestible summaries.
However, they can't be used to infer new information.
