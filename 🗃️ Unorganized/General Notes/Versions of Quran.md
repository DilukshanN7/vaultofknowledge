# Situation and Problems
Source: https://www.ugr.es/~mreligio/materiales/Green.Samuel_The-different-arabic-versions-of-the-Quran.pdf

- Uthman destroyed all other copies of the Quran, and the differences between the ahrufs
- So the claim that any of the recitations can be traced back to Mohammed is false
- Everything can be traced back to the Uthmanic manuscript
- So there are ten Q'aris (reciters) and seven Ahrufs (modes, as per the Hadith)
- Muslims do not accept all of them as valid, they choose the best one for reading
- Because "it is ridiculous to believe that God gave the recitation in different variants and we have to pick and choose"
- There are 7 Mutawatir recitations and 3 Mashhur recitations
