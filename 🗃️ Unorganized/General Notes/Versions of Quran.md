# How they differ
## Glossary
- Rawi / Ruwah: Transmitter(s)
- Q'ari / Qurra': Reciter(s)
- Qira'ah (singular) / Qira'at (plural): Recitation(s)
- Ahruf: Mode
- Tajwid: The rules of pronunciation, intonation, and caesuras of the Qur'an

They say the recitation was given to Mohammed in 7 different Ahrufs according to a Hadeeth, and therefore each recitation can be traced back to Mohammed.
# The different editions
- **Hafs** (Hafs an Asim an al-Sulami; an means from)
- **Warsh** (Warsh an Nafi; an means from)
- **Asad**

Muslims say the Quran was revealed in 7 styles to Mohammed, so all are from Allah.
# Situation and Problems
Source: https://www.ugr.es/~mreligio/materiales/Green.Samuel_The-different-arabic-versions-of-the-Quran.pdf

- Uthman destroyed all other copies of the Quran, and the differences between the ahrufs
- So the claim that any of the recitations can be traced back to Mohammed is false
- Everything can be traced back to the Uthmanic manuscript
- So there are ten Q'aris (reciters) and seven Ahrufs (modes, as per the Hadith)
- Muslims do not accept all of them as valid, they choose the best one for reading
- Because "it is ridiculous to believe that God gave the recitation in different variants and we have to pick and choose"
- There are 7 Mutawatir recitations and 3 Mashhur recitations
