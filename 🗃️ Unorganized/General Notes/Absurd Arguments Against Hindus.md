Firstly, they make the case that Hinduism is a monolithic religion, and that it is based on a text called the Manu Smriti.

**Then they say that all of them are characterized by these following unempathetic practices:**
- Sati
- Devadasi System
- Caste System
- Ayyappa Swami Kshethra (menstruating women not allowed to visit)
- Slavery of women by forcing them to be bare breasted

Then they say that:
1> This is an effect of polytheism
2> All polytheism is a man-made religion to satisfy man's desire in violation of God's law
3> All polytheism is evil
# Firstly, My Opinion
If you don't know anything about a culture, then stop judging it. Judge it for the specific elements that it held and were problematic. But if the culture itself allows reformation of the norms, unlike some other cultures that consider their texts as a basis for eternal morality, there is no point in criticizing the culture for its historical practices that are not moral by today's standards. The people who do this assume that they are a breed specially different from the rest that happened to have not committed any mistakes at all.

But when we specifically refer to Christians or Muslims, they consider themselves as sinners, by moral codes that they bring forward with their texts, even though others don't agree with them, and still tell them to repent according to the principles of their belief system. This is again a problem that comes with their belief system that forces other people to adapt to their belief systems. These systems then cause the problem of not being able to solve problems even when a better way exists, because they say that it is the unchangeable word given to them by a dualistic creator being called God, who is jealous and demands worship and complete belief, regardless of evidence.

In fact, scripture itself is considered something that can be heard, and the written works are only trusted by our trust in its authors (i.e. Apara Vidya). The theology is that the truth (Para Vidya) can be heard directly through mediation.
	- The Castes themselves are described in the Vedas written by Vedavyaasa, but it never referred to them in terms of hierarchy, but rather by analogy to the part of the body by which they carry out their works. It also did not refer to the idea that a person is born into a caste by the virtue of their birth, but rather, it was said to be a description of their choice of profession.
	- The Bhagavad Gita, a mythological excerpt that is also considered valid scripture does however mention that all the castes and their hierarchies were created by God, who presents themself as Krishna. They say that they did so to carry out their storyline, but also says that all castes really are equal. In effect, it
