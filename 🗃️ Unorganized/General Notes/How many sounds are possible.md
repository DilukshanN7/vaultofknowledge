Highest audible [[beat frequency]]: 10 (maximum different sounds one can hear in a second)
Number of frequencies: 20 kHz

Discrete audible volumes?
Discrete audible intervals:

Some say 1/12th of a half-step (i.e. 8 cents)
Some say 0.5% of a frequency makes a noticable difference (and 1000-1002 Hz makes a perceptible difference)
Some say for low frequencies or high frequencies results may vary, but for human speech range, the results we may be able to tell apart 2-3 cents

5 cents is a good number to work with. 25 cents would be it for an average adult.
