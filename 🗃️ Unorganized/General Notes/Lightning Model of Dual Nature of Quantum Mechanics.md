Or more generally, the electromagnetic current propagation model of quantum mechanics.

That is, current flows because a source of with a given strong potential attracts charged particles towards itself. Of course, if it attracts one kind of charged particles, it repels the oppositely charged particles.

This is why low voltage cells need a solid conducting material to push or pull their free electrons easily in order to complete the circuit.

But in high voltage cells, they have enough power to attract or repel whole particles containing charges from their surroundings, pulling them through the free space.
