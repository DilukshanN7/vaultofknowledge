# Notes
## Code Division Multiple Access
### Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Acces
DS-CDMA (Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access) is a multiple access scheme based on [[Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum|DSSS]], by spreading the signals from/to different users with different codes. 

It is the most widely used type of CDMA.

## Frequency Division Multiple Access
It is based on [[Frequency Division Multiplexing]] (FDM).
### Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
### Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access
Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), a.k.a. linearly-precoded OFDMA (LP-OFDMA)

It is based on Single-Carrier Frequency Domain Equalization (SC-FDE). 
## Wavelength Division Multiple Access
It is based on [[Wavelength Division Multiplexing]] (WDM).
