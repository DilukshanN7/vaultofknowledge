Why I cannot lie:

I cannot place one foot forward unless capitalism is wiped off the face of the people of earth.

But eradicating capitalism is not that easy. It will only be applicable to developed civilizations.
As for underdeveloped societies, 

I'm referencing the idea from the TV series franchise, Star Trek.


But there is major difference between my philosophy and Marx's:
Marx said that the labour relationships and means of production form the base of the society, while religion forms the superstructure.

However, in my philosophy, feelings form the base of the society. From feelings, we create language. And from language, we build a civilization. And to set order to the civilization, we build religion. (Feelings -> Language -> Civilization -> Religion).

Proto-Indo-European -> Indo-Iranian (Aryan) -> Avestan Gathas (Persia), Sanskrit Vedas (India) e.g. Dyaus / Dyaus Pitr
Proto-Indo-European -> Proto-Greek -> Greek (Greece) e.g. Zues / Zeus Pater
Proto-Indo-European -> Proto-Italic -> Latin (Rome) e.g. Jove / Jove Pater (Jupiter)

Another important phenomenon was that, the early Proto-Indo-European religion seemed to have originated with a contrasing daylight sky god (dweys phter) and a dark earth god (dhegom mehter) as his consort. From dweys, we got alongside dyaus, the word daiv, meaning god, and similarly, we got asura from a similar word. We also got mother earth, but from a different word, pletwih, plet being the root for flat. The word being Prithvi. Now the funny part is, the Indo-Iranians, who are recorded to have described themselves as Aryans, split into Indo-Aryans and Iranians. While Indo-Aryans developed Sanskrit Vedas with devas and asuras, Iranians developed Avesatan Gathas where Ashura is the only god, and daivas are demons. This religion was Zoroastrianism as we know today, and the Gathas were written by Zarathustra (Zoroaster). This religion also involved prophets, end times, resurrection of the dead, angels and prohibition of idolatry - something which we are familiar with in Judaism.

So, the reason for the Babylonian Exile and destruction of Solomon's Temple was given as the practice of idolatry in Yisra'el. They were in exile for 70 years, and at the end, it was the First Persian Empire under Cyrus the Great that freed them, and gave them the province of Yehud Medinata. During their time in mix with the Zoroastrians, they were reminded of the importance of monotheism, and seem to have taken ideas from the fellow monotheistic religion. This is the time when they seem to have incorporated ideas of the end days, prophets, etc. into their religion (hearsay, I haven't verified this). The Book of Daniel is the first that begins to talk of the end times (again hearsay, I've not read beyond the Torah / Pentateuch).

Examples in China: Obey The Law (Legalism), Philosophy (They way of Confucius), The Tao
Other Examples: Law (Codex Hammurabi), Law of Religion (Halakha, Shari'ah, Sanatan Dharma), Swiss Civil Code
I don't know much about how laws are made in democracies. I hear that India follows Sanatan Dharma. However, it is not my religion, so I do not know much about it.
