It refers to a language trick where one uses words that can mean multiple different things, when they could've instead used a more clear combination of words. This is used to hide an agenda while carrying it out through other means.

Example:
- Two dead in officer-involved shooting
	- Did the police shoot two suspects?
	- Did the police shoot one suspect and one innocent?
	- Did the police shoot two innocents?
	- Did the police shoot innocents while trying to shoot suspects?
	- Did the suspects and police shoot each other and some others died?
	- Did two people kill each other when an officer was nearby?
