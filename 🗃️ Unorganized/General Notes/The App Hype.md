I guess Apple started this.

I mean, reinventing is great, and is my thing, but I don't appreciate the hype that much.

# What is an app really?
App, is short for Application.

An application is a type of computer program that faces the user, and performs a task. For example: A word processor, an e-mail client, 

This is different from utility software, which performs tasks which the user would like to get done, but don't interact with much. For example, Virus Scanners, Backup Utilities, Video Conversion Utilities.

Windows used to refer to all user-space software as programs, and any system provided applications would be classified as accessories (such as Wordpad, Paint, etc.)







# My Ideas of Software
- Infrastructure Software: General Purpose Infrastructure Software (Replaces [[Enterprise Management Software|EMS]])
- Organization Software: Software tailored to a specific Organization (is expected to have interfaces with other infrastructure software)
- Network Service Software: Software that provides network services (Self-hosting / Web Applications)

- Local Service (e.g. Container Service, Waydroid Session, ADB Server, Download Manager)
- Utilities (e.g. Video Converters, Virus Scanners, Compiler)
- Applications (e.g. )
- System Software (e.g. Service Software Manager, Disk Checker)
- System Service (e.g. Service Software Monitor, ACPI, Defragmenter)
- Software Library Runtimes (e.g. System API Runtime, Application Specific Runtimes)
- Media and Games (Games are a combination of Media and Application)

- Applications vs Clients?
- Notion is an application, but Firefox is a Client, or an Accessory
- Office Suites are also application software, not accessories

Software can be further divided into Local and Network software.

\* There's only just software. All software either runs directly on the CPU, or it is dependent (or restricted) on other software such as the booted **Kernel**, **Kernel+System API Runtime** (aka the OS), **Kernel+System API Runtime+Application Specific Runtime**, or just an **Application Specific Runtime** (in which case, the runtime already depends on the OS, without the developer having to worry about it)
