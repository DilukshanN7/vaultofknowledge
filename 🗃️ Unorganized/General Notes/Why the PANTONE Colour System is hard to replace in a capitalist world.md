PANTONE is a proprietary colour system. They have dominated the colour standardization industry by having a named library of colours which required a fee to legally reproduce. Even a company like Adobe wasn't exempt from their licensing.

The textiles and literally every other industry is dependent on Pantone for colour referencing. They also have colours that cannot be reproduced on screen ([[RGB Colour Spaces|RGB]] / [[Cylindrical Colour Space Models|Cylindrical]]), as well as with printing ink ([[CMYK Colour Model|CMYK]]). They also have special colours like metallic colours etc. So their colour library has a value, although it definitely isn't magic.

Stuart Little has created a free alternative to PANTONE, namely FREETONE. But it can't simply replace PANTONE just like that.

From Reddit:
> The problem is that the base pigments (that are then used to mix the spot colors) still need to be produced by a manufacturer. This has to be done consistently so the resulting color is always the same. To create a full open color matching system **you would need companies to share their company secrets how they manufacture their colors** and then cooperate together in a huge system.

# More technical details
This has topics I have more to study about, but I have some notes taken on it already, so I have a general idea.

- How are colours made?
	- What are colours even (Ink, Dyes, Pigments)?
		- Paint is comprised of **Pigments, Dyes or Fillers** and **Vehicle**
			- ## Pigments, Dyes or Fillers
				- **Pigments** are granular solids incorporated in paints to give colour
				- **Dyes** are colourants that dissolve in paint
				- **Fillers** are granular solids incorporated in paints to give texture, toughness and other special properties
			- ## Vehicle (Binder / Binder + Solvent)
				- **Binder**
					- It is the adhesive that holds the paint together into a film.
					- Film refers to whatever remains after the solvent component is evaporated (so we have thin layer or film holding together the paint on the surface)
				- **Solvent**
					- If the vehicle has to be thinned, a diluent or solvent is used alongside the binder.
					- They adjust the viscosity of the paint
			- ## Additives
				- They may be used to adjust special properties like surface tension, bacterial grown, anti-freeze, etc.<br><br>
- How does paint work?
	- Physical paint always uses subtractive mixing, as more components absorb more light, they are not sources. <br><br>
- The special formulas in which certain paints are made are standardized by PANTONE.
	- A formula is not magic, but a consistent procedure.<br><br>
So what you need to realize is that paint and colours are nothing more than everyday objects just provided to you in a mixed and mashed form.

After all, they are just colourful because they have a characteristic frequency and our three kinds of cone cells have different
