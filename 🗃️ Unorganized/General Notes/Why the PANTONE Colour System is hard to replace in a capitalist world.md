PANTONE is a proprietary colour system. They have dominated the colour standardization industry by having a named library of colours which required a fee to legally reproduce. Even a company like Adobe wasn't exempt from their licensing.

The textiles and literally every other industry is dependent on Pantone for colour referencing. They also have colours that cannot be reproduced on screen ([[RGB Colour Spaces|RGB]] / [[Cylindrical Colour Space Models|Cylindrical]]), as well as with printing ink ([[CMYK Colour Model|CMYK]]). They also have special colours like metallic colours etc. So their colour library has a value, although it definitely isn't magic.

Stuart Little has created a free alternative to PANTONE, namely FREETONE. But it can't simply replace PANTONE just like that.
# Why is it hard to replace with a free standard?

From Reddit:
> The problem is that the base pigments (that are then used to mix the spot colors) still need to be produced by a manufacturer. This has to be done consistently so the resulting color is always the same. To create a full open color matching system **you would need companies to share their company secrets how they manufacture their colors** and then cooperate together in a huge system.

This has topics I have more to study about, but I have some notes taken on it already, so I have a general idea.
