## In religion
An icon (from Ancient Greek εἰκών (eikṓn) 'image, resemblance') is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, in the cultures of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Catholic churches.
## In cultures
A cultural icon is a person or an artifact that is identified by members of a culture as representative of that culture.

e.g. Mount Fuji for Japan, Red Telephone Box for Britain, Apple Pies for USA, Matryoshka Dolls for Russia (alongside USSR, Hammer and Sickle and Vladimir Lenin)

Religious icons can become cultural icons, if the religion is deeply ingrained to the culture.
## In computing
An icon is a pictogram or ideogram displayed on a computer screen in order to help the user navigate a computer system.

The computing definition of "icon" can include three distinct [[semiotics|semiotical]] elements:

- Icon (Direct Resemblance to the Referent)
	- e.g. printers, scissors, file cabinets, folders, etc.
- Index (Associated to the Referent)
	- e.g. stylized drawings used to refer to actions, like "printer" for "print", "scissors" for "cut", "magnifying glass" for "search", etc.
- Symbol, which is related to its referent only by convention (letters, musical notation, mathematical operators etc.)
	- e.g. Standard symbols such as power on / offf, USB icon, etc.

The majority of icons are encoded and decoded using the following parameters:
- Metonymy
- Synecdoche
- Metaphor
