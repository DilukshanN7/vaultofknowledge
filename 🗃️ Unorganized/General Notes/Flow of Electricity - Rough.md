# Electricity

# Heat Transfer
- Heat is potential energy in the electrons
- In a hot kettle, the metal surface is trying to excite air molecules and release the heat
- But when you pour water on it, since the molecules are closer, they conduct heat quickly and relieve the hot body, by vaporizing itself.
# Matter Waves
- Moving charges disturb the electromagnetic field
	- Consider the particulate nature of propagating waves too (they do not drop in amplitude beyond a certain point, and instead, it moves as point particles)
		- I could assume that the electrons always simply shoots point photons spherically outward
			- It's almost as though photons are to the electromagnetic field as what water molecules are to water - to the fullest degree
				- That is, waves of water or air move due to individual molecules oscillating
				- Molecules disturb other molecules, because they were excited by a force from the general direction
				- So it is as if the force carrier's photons entered the system of the medium, and the medium started propagating it
				- [Q:] But how does the force carrier enter the medium?
				- I would model it as that the electron cloud goes in and out in each cycle, due to the push and pull it receives from the nucleus, and during this time, new photons may get absorbed, and the next 
				- [Q:] But how does it explain how moving charges radiate electromagnetic waves
				- Good question. But as we know, it is not just any moving charges, but accelerating charges that radiate electromagnetic waves.
