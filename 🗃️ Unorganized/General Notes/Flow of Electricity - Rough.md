# Electricity

# Heat Transfer
- Heat is potential energy in the electrons
- In a hot kettle, the metal surface is trying to excite air molecules and release the heat
- But when you pour water on it, since the molecules are closer, they conduct heat quickly and relieve the hot body, by vaporizing itself.
# Waves
- Moving charges disturb the electromagnetic field
	- Consider the particulate nature of propagating waves too (they do not drop in amplitude beyond a certain point, and instead )
