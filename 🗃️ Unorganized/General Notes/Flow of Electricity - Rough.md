# Electricity

# Heat Transfer
- Heat is potential energy in the electrons
- In a hot kettle, the metal surface is trying to excite air molecules and release the heat
- But when you pour water on it, since the molecules are closer, they conduct heat quickly and relieve the hot body, by vaporizing itself.
# Matter Waves
- Moving charges disturb the electromagnetic field
	- Consider the particulate nature of propagating waves too (they do not drop in amplitude beyond a certain point, and instead, it moves as point particles)
		- I could assume that the electrons always simply shoots point photons spherically outward
			- It's almost as though photons are to the electromagnetic field as what water molecules are to water - to the fullest degree
				- That is, waves of water or air move due to individual molecules oscillating
				- Molecules disturb other molecules, because they were excited by a force
