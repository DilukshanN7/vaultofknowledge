KDE is a desktop environment based on Qt

Qt apps usually get their style from the desktop environment, and this is handled well by large desktop environments like KDE Plasma and GNOME.

Other desktop environments or compositors will need to use Qt configuration tools called `qt5ct` and `qt6ct`, by passing them as an environment variable as follows:
`QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct`.

Like any other UI library, Qt theming can also be split into widget styles, window decorations, colour schemes, icon themes, cursor themes and fonts.

Out of these, cursor themes and icon themes are fairly generalizable to other libraries too. But widget styles, decorations and colour schemes will be tied to the library.
