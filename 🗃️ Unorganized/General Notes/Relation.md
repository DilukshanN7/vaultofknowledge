A relation describes as a connection between the elements of a [[set]], and that may or may not hold between two elements of that set.

For example, in the set of natural numbers, the relation "is less than" does not hold between 5 and 4, but it does between 4 and 5.

## Formal Definition
Given a set $X$, a relation $R$ over $X$ is a set of [[ordered pairs]] of elements from $X$, then:

$R \subseteq \{(x,y)|x,y \in X\}$

The statement $(x,y) \in R$ reads "$x$ is $R$-related to $y$", and is written in the
