Lev 20:24-26 states that the rules (Lev 20:13, etc.) are for the people of Israel.
It is also the responsibility of the Judges (Dt 17:6-9).
The Church cannot punish sinners, only the government can (Romans 13:1-4).

Lev 1:1-2 states that the book is for Israel.

We are in the Church age (Eph 3:1-5).
Lord will deal with Israel in the End Times (Rev 7-19).
Paul is the APostle of the Gentiles (Rom 11:11-13).
But only a small portion of the Bible is to Gentiles, most others are to Israel.
Bible doesn't specify or condemn death penality to homosexuals. But it doesn't oppose.
Romans 13:1-4 gives the state the power to execute criminals, but doesn't specify what is criminal.

God doesn't always want what's moral.
He wants his plan done.

Christians justify that God ordered to kill all babies.
They justify that if God says so, killing people is moral.

- People justifying killing polytheists
	- Surah 9:5 isn't forbidden afterwards.
	- Also, treaty is irrelevant for when Muslims conquered the land, meaning a treaty was broken.
	- They remove parts of 2:191 saying drive them out from where they drove you out (meaning they came to attack you)
	- They reply, emotions will lead you to failure, and follow the jurisprudence books, like the Book of Jihad
