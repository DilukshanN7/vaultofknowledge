## Old Testament and Talmud
- Old Testament
	- Hatred of Pagans
		- Psalm 106:37
	- Story of Lot and Gomorrah
	- Samson's Marriage
		- Judges 14:16
	- Don't Hide Your Sins (Good)
		- Proverbs 28:13
- Talmud
	- Sanhedrin 43a (Stoning Jesus)
		- He violated Deuteronomy 13:11-12 (Misleading people) and Leviticus 20:27 (Spirit Telling).

Sin (chet) is a result of improper channeling of our human impulses (Yetzer). We have Yetzer-Hatov (Good Inclination) and Yetzer-Hara (Good/Bad Inclination). And God forgives.

It is commonly said that Israel claimed to be superior than the others. But really, Israel only claims to be people chosen for a purpose. A commonly cited Talmud excerpt (Yevamot 62a.14) is that the Israelites consider Gentiles to be like donkeys, considering it to be pejorative. However, that was only a metaphoric tool used for declaring the legal status of the lineage a Gentile who wants to be Jew. The term donkey is not used in a pejorative sense.

The reality on how Israel views Gentiles is given in another excerpt where the Israelites consider Gentiles to be like dogs and themselves to be like donkeys. So when we walk the Earth, the commandments are like luggage. And the dogs, tired of the luggage, placed the burden on the donkeys, so that they both can walk in comfort. So the reference to dogs was only made in the sense that Israelites work harder for the sake of the Gentiles. This is from Sifrei Devarim 343:6 (donkey is written as ass, in case you don't see it with Ctrl+F). Sifrei Devarim is a Midrash text on the Book of Deuteronomy composed in 200 CE by Rabbi Akiva.

However, Mohammed said that they are like donkeys carrying around the Torah, by not understanding its contents (Quran 62:5).


Also, sin of Sodom was not explicitly mentioned as homosexuality by any prophets. They were only mentioned as wicked.
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&pg=PA37&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false
It was the Church that decided to call homosexuality the sin, although the prophets only refer to Sodom the city.
The people of Sodom tried to mass-rape the two heavenly emissaries.

## Notes on where and how the laws apply
Lev 20:24-26 states that the rules (Lev 20:13, etc.) are for the people of Israel.
It is also the responsibility of the Judges (Dt 17:6-9).
The Church cannot punish sinners, only the government can (Romans 13:1-4).
Lev 1:1-2 states that the book is for Israel.

We are in the Church age (Eph 3:1-5).
Lord will deal with Israel in the End Times (Rev 7-19).
Paul is the Apostle of the Gentiles (Rom 11:11-13).
But only a small portion of the Bible is to Gentiles, most others are to Israel.
Bible doesn't specify or condemn death penality to homosexuals. But it doesn't oppose.
Romans 13:1-4 gives the state the power to execute criminals, but doesn't specify what is criminal.

God doesn't always want what's moral.
He wants his plan done.

## ## Nature of Christians outside the Bible
- How Christians are in practice
https://www.gotquestions.org/father-of-lies.html
> Some of his more common lies are “there is no God,” “God doesn’t care about you,” “the Bible cannot be trusted,” and “your good works will get you into heaven.”

Christians justify that God ordered to kill all babies.
They justify that if God says so, killing people is moral.

They say that death is everywhere and humans cannot be united.
This is wishful thinking.

- The claim that Islam made people release slaves

	- Suppose I could buy games for currency
	- Will I be inclined to spend currency for games, or to hoard currency?

Sahih Bukhari 9:89:296 states “The Prophet (ﷺ) came to know that one of his companions had given the promise of freeing his slave after his death, but as he had no other property than that slave, the Prophet (ﷺ) sold that slave for 800 dirhams and sent the price to him.”

- Logical Inconsistency of Slaves
	- If both a wife and husband are slaves, the owner can't have sex with them
	- The slave girl can deny sex
	- The slave girl cannot be forced to work

You chose to humble yourselves. But who is it that you chose to humble yourselves towards?
You chose to humble yourselves towards someone who asked of you, to cast aside your humanity.
What does that make you?
