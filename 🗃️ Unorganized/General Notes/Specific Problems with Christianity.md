## Old Testament and Talmud
- Old Testament
	- Hatred of Pagans
		- Psalm 106:37
	- Story of Lot and Gomorrah
	- Samson's Marriage
		- Judges 14:16
	- Don't Hide Your Sins (Good)
		- Proverbs 28:13
- Talmud
	- Sanhedrin 43a (Stoning Jesus)
		- He violated Deuteronomy 13:11-12 (Misleading people) and Leviticus 20:27 (Spirit Telling).

Sin (chet) is a result of improper channeling of our human impulses (Yetzer). We have Yetzer-Hatov (Good Inclination) and Yetzer-Hara (Good/Bad Inclination). And God forgives.

It is commonly said that Israel claimed to be superior than the others. But really, Israel only claims to be people chosen for a purpose. A commonly cited Talmud excerpt (Yevamot 62a.14) is that the Israelites consider Gentiles to be like donkeys, considering it to be pejorative. However, that was only a metaphoric tool used for declaring the legal status of the lineage a Gentile who wants to be Jew. The term donkey is not used in a pejorative sense.

The reality on how Israel views Gentiles is given in another excerpt where the Israelites consider Gentiles to be like dogs and themselves to be like donkeys. So when we walk the Earth, the commandments are like luggage. And the dogs, tired of the luggage, placed the burden on the donkeys, so that they both can walk in comfort. So the reference to dogs was only made in the sense that Israelites work harder for the sake of the Gentiles. This is from Sifrei Devarim 343:6 (donkey is written as ass, in case you don't see it with Ctrl+F). Sifrei Devarim is a Midrash text on the Book of Deuteronomy composed in 200 CE by Rabbi Akiva.

However, Mohammed said that they are like donkeys carrying around the Torah, by not understanding its contents (Quran 62:5).


Also, sin of Sodom was not explicitly mentioned as homosexuality by any prophets. They were only mentioned as wicked.

It was the Church that decided to call homosexuality the sin, although the prophets only refer to Sodom the city.
The people of Sodom tried to mass-rape the two heavenly emissaries.

## Notes on where and how the laws apply
Lev 20:24-26 states that the rules (Lev 20:13, etc.) are for the people of Israel.
It is also the responsibility of the Judges (Dt 17:6-9).
The Church cannot punish sinners, only the government can (Romans 13:1-4).
Lev 1:1-2 states that the book is for Israel.

We are in the Church age (Eph 3:1-5).
Lord will deal with Israel in the End Times (Rev 7-19).
Paul is the Apostle of the Gentiles (Rom 11:11-13).
But only a small portion of the Bible is to Gentiles, most others are to Israel.
Bible doesn't specify or condemn death penality to homosexuals. But it doesn't oppose.
Romans 13:1-4 gives the state the power to execute criminals, but doesn't specify what is criminal.

God doesn't always want what's moral.
He wants his plan done.

## ## Nature of Christians outside the Bible
- How Christians are in practice
https://www.gotquestions.org/father-of-lies.html
> Some of his more common lies are “there is no God,” “God doesn’t care about you,” “the Bible cannot be trusted,” and “your good works will get you into heaven.”

Christians justify that God ordered to kill all babies.
They justify that if God says so, killing people is moral.

They say that death is everywhere and humans cannot be united.
This is wishful thinking.

		- People say that killing baby Hitler is okay, but not killing any babies by knowing of their potential evil nature. But they ignore something fundamental about how evil arises as an emergent phenomena, not as something spiritual.
	- Taking Sex Slaves
		- They have to take care of the captive women, and they can get intimate with them without nikah
			- Exceptions are pregnant women and women whose husbands are also made captives
			- But all adults are killed during war, so husbands cannot actually be captured.
		- 23:5-7 (Those who lose chastity not with wives or sex-slaves are transgressors)
		- 4:3 (Content yourselves with one of your bondwomen, if you can't treat 4 wives justly)
			- Christianity also sets the number of wives to one.
			- In Judaism, the number of wives was ideally one.
		- 70:29-31 (Same as 23:5-7, verbatim)
		- 4:24 (Married female captives are legal for marriage)
		- 4:25 (Impatient men who can't find a free Muslim woman should be given a **Muslim\*** slave women to marry, if the master hasn't had relations with them)
			- True\* translation (doubtful, I guess I'm wrong by most Tafsirs): It says slaves of Muslims should be given, not Muslims slaves. I read the Arabic translation (maybe my bad).
			- More Notes:
				- This is for impatient men. They can't marry slaves if they have free wives. (But what about Aisha Mohammed Hadith? I'll see)
					- But they can marry multiple slaves, although if they already have one wife, they can't be considered impatient? Scholars vary. Some say he's satisfied, others say one can have upto 4 wives to be satisfied.
				- Owners can't marry slaves without freeing them. But he can have sex.
					- This is because the contract of ownership is stronger than the contract of marriage. And one cannot have both, the contract of ownership supersedes, until she's freed.
						- And this is because the contracts of marriage give more rights that the contracts of slavery does not. So if she's not given those rights, it will make a contradiction.
			- **Now, why would a slave believe? What would she gain?**
				- The master can have sex with her whether she believes or not, so no gain.
				- Some impatient guy can have sex with her if she believes, so a downside.
				- Also acceptance of Islam nullifies her previous marriage (if husband is alive), so, unfaithful.
				- Is she coerced?
		- 30:28 (Would you ever allow your slaves to be equal partners in wealth to you?)
		- 24:33 (Only guideline: do not make them prostitutes to earn money / pimp)
		- 33:50 (Have relationships with wives to whom you've paid dowry to, and slave women)
		- Freeing slaves to make up for sins is mentioned, but one could also just repent
		- A slave woman could reject her master for illness, etc.
		- Don't marry polytheist women, believing slaves are better
			- Although slaves by definition would be originally non-Muslims
		- Many Tafsirs say that one can force slaves to do nikah, or marry them off without consent
	- Treatment of Slaves
		- If a slave woman is married by the owner, the children will be free
		- If a slave woman is married to another man, the children will be slaves of the owner
		- By marrying slaves off, the owner gets more slaves, and is lifted of the burden of accommodating them.
	- Polygamy is good for men, bad for women
	- Some Muslims think it's okay to lie during Dawah (invitation/preaching)
	- God split water and heavens
		- 21:30
		- This is out of Genesis
		- Contradictions
			- God made every living thing (in Earth) out of water (21:30)
			- God make Jinn from smokeless flame (55:15)
				- Muslim claim: Jinn was made before earth

			- **3015 (Jihad, Hadeeth 224):** During some of the Ghazawat of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) a woman was found killed, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade the killing of women and children.
				- Note how it doesn't say kill only those who fight, so all adult males are to be killed (ones with pubic hair).
	- Killing all adult males who had pubic hair after battle
		- Jami at-Tirmidhi (Sahih)
			- **1584 (The Book on Military Expeditions, Hadeeth 41):** "We were presented to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the day of (the battle of) Quraizah. Whoever had pubic hair was killed and whoever did not was left to his way. I was of those who did not have pubic hair so I was left to my way." Abu 'Eisa said: This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. This is acted upon according to some of the people of knowledge. They consider pubic hair an indication of the age of responsibility, if it is not known whether he has had a wet dream, or his age. This is the view of Ahmad and Ishaq.

	- Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi’ and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying ‘I don’t accept it; we didn’t find any such thing in the Book of Allah.’” Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663).

- People justifying killing polytheists
	- Surah 9:5 isn't forbidden afterwards.
	- Also, treaty is irrelevant for when Muslims conquered the land, meaning a treaty was broken.

## Philosophizing
- The claim that Islam made people release slaves
	- The idea is that slaves could be released, as one of the ways to erase sins
	- Suppose I could buy games for currency
	- Will I be inclined to spend currency for games, or to hoard currency?

Sahih Bukhari 9:89:296 states “The Prophet (ﷺ) came to know that one of his companions had given the promise of freeing his slave after his death, but as he had no other property than that slave, the Prophet (ﷺ) sold that slave for 800 dirhams and sent the price to him.”

- Logical Inconsistency of Slaves
	- If both a wife and husband are slaves, the owner can't have sex with them
	- The slave girl can deny sex
	- The slave girl cannot be forced to work

You chose to humble yourselves. But who is it that you chose to humble yourselves towards?
You chose to humble yourselves towards someone who asked of you, to cast aside your humanity.
What does that make you?

**Killing people:**
Like-wise, the famous Hanafi scholar al-Kashani said, “The principle is that it is permissible to kill anyone from amongst the people who are at war (with the Muslims), whether they fight or do not fight.

**The problem with taking a religion ("no contradictions"):**
Say I sharpen a pencil. I can put the waste in my box (in a waste section), or walk up to the dustbin. Is there a contradiction in any of these actions? No. But someone can put it on the floor. It could be argued that it is harmful for the environment or the workers. But the person could say that they don't care about workers or the environment. Now, to change his mind is a very difficult task. Although there are no contradictions in this situation, there are contradictions when you consider the larger picture.

**What I mean when I say Islam is harmful:**
When I say that I know that Islam is harmful, even more than Muslims, I say it in a similar manner as I know that Alcohol is harmful even without drinking alcohol myself. Of course, moderate alcoholics do not pose a problem, but I can still know that if someone gets them to try something stronger, and being alcoholics, they are less likely to 

But realistically
Hell, it is even realistic for Christianity.


- **Who all can be captives?**
	- Claim: Only females who fight can be captured
	- Claim: Only men who fight can be killed.

- **What happens when you fight**
	- People of the Book can pay Jizya
	- Others will have to be fought till they convert
		- **Hanafi School:** Jizya can be taken from everyone except Arab polytheists and apostates
		- **Maliki School:** Jizya can be taken from everyone except apostates
		- **Shafi'i and Hanbali Schools:** Jizya can be taken from Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians (Ahl al-Kitab)

This guy quotes Mughal Emperor Aurangazeb's fatwa for Jizya (to not take it from Hindus): (https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2e5utf/comment/kqi8g8i/)

He also says that fitrah is innate to all humans, and it is only later in life that they are indoctrinated to Christianity and atheism. And he complains that the rules of Jizya are perfect even to those who are denied it, unlike the western world which lets everyone live, because it is according to the whims of man, while Islam is the unwavering absolute truth as commanded by God.

| They didn't start a battle, but the Arabs fought them when they went with the partition plan. So they fought the battle, but they didn't kill everyone. Instead, 20% of Israelis are Arabs. And they didn't collect something like Jizya from them to humiliate them to let them live there. | So they killed every single member of those tribes, "except those from The People of The Book (Ahl Al-Kitab)", "who paid Jizya tax", "in humiliation to Islam" (Surah 9, Ayah 5). |

		- Translator translation: The word isn't puberty, but "since I could recall".
		- Aishab Yuli's translation (464): I have no recollection of my parents doing anything but following Islam.
	- Sahih al-Bukhari 2297

- Waiting period for divorce is only three months for girls above menstruating age
	- Verse 65:4
	- For Jews, the similar idea (about virginity) was about rape.
	- For Muslims, this is about divorce.

When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)
