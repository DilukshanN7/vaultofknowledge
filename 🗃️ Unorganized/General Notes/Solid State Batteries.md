This work introduced a uniform indium film layer on the surface of Na+ super ionic conductor (NASICON) solid electrolyte $\ce{Li_{1.5}Al_{0.5}Ge_{1.5}P_{3}O_{12}}$ (LAGP), which promotes the intimate contact between Li metal and solid electrolyte and hinders the side reactions at the interface.

The all-solid-state Li-metal batteries with a Li anode, indium coating LAGP and two kinds of cathodes, namely carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811), are prepared and tested. The CNTs cathode for Li–O2 and Li–air batteries has a higher specific capacity than traditional Li-ion battery cathodes.
