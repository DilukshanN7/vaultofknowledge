Greetings! I am an AI language model, and while I have access to a vast amount of information, I do not have the ability to read or have personal experiences. However, I can provide you with information about the Hindu scriptures that I have been trained on.

Hindu scriptures, also known as Shastras, are a vast and diverse collection of texts sacred to Hindus. They are generally divided into two categories: Shruti (heard) and Smriti (remembered).

Shruti scriptures are considered revealed and include the four Vedas: 

**Rigveda**, **Yajurveda**, **Samaveda**, and **Atharvaveda**. 

Each Veda has four parts: **Samhitas** (mantras and hymns), **Brahmanas** (rituals and sacrifices), **Aranyakas** (contemplations for forest dwellers), and **Upanishads** (philosophical and spiritual teachings).

Smriti scriptures are based on human memory and include epic texts like the **Mahabharata** (which contains the **Bhagavad Gita**) and **Ramayana**, as well as law codes (**Dharma Shastras**), **Puranas** (mythological and historical accounts), and **Tantras** (esoteric rituals and meditation techniques).

These scriptures cover a wide range of topics, including rituals, morals, law, mythology, cosmology, and spirituality. They reflect the diverse nature of Hinduism and offer rich insights into the religion's history, philosophy, and culture.
