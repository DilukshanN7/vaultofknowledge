The standard electrode potential ($\text{E}^\ominus$) is expressed as the *reduction potential*. The electrochemical potential difference of a cell is then given as:

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{cell} = \text{E}^\ominus_\text{cathode} - \text{E}^\ominus_\text{anode}$

However, the potential of the reaction at the anode is \*sometimes\* expressed as an _oxidation potential_:

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{oxidation} = -\text{E}^\ominus_\text{reduction}$

The oxidation potential is a measure of the tendency of the reducing agent to be oxidized but does not represent the physical potential at an electrode. With this notation, the cell voltage equation is written with a plus sign.

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{cell} = \text{E}^\ominus_\text{oxidation} + \text{E}^\ominus_\text{reduction}$

> [!NOTE] 
> **If you get confused:** basically the half-cells want to do their spontaneous reactions, whether it be oxidation or reduction. Where there is oxidation, there is a reduction too ([[redox reactions]]). So their potentials will add up to give the cell's electrochemical potential.
# Definition
The standard reduction potential ${\displaystyle E_{reduction}^{\ominus}}$ is measured under standard conditions: ==T = 298.15 K (25 °C / 77 °F), a unity activity (a = 1) for each ion participating into the reaction, a partial pressure of 1 atm (1.013 bar) for each gas taking part into the reaction, and metals in their pure state.==

The standard reduction potential ${\displaystyle E_{reduction}^{\ominus }}$ is defined relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). However, because these can also be referred to as "redox potentials", the terms "reduction potentials" and "oxidation potentials" are preferred by the IUPAC.

The two may be explicitly distinguished by the symbols ${\displaystyle E_{reduction}}$ and ${\displaystyle E_{oxidation}}$, with ${\displaystyle E_{oxidation}=-E_{reduction}}$.

## Basics
The **reaction quotient** ($\displaystyle \text{Q}_\text{r}$), also often called the ion activity product (IAP), is the ratio between the **chemical activities** ($\displaystyle \text {a}$) of the reduced form (the reductant, $\displaystyle \text{a}_\text{reduction}$) and the oxidized form (the oxidant, $\displaystyle \text{a}_\text{oxidation}$). 

The chemical activity of a dissolved species corresponds to its true thermodynamic concentration taking into account the electrical interactions between all ions present in solution at elevated concentrations.

When the **[[chemical potential]]** of a reaction is calculated by the laws of thermodynamics, non-ideal solutions have to be accommodated using **chemical activity** ($\displaystyle \text{a}$) by multiplying the **molar ($\displaystyle \text{mol/L solution}$), or molal ($\displaystyle \text{mol/kg water}$), concentration** ($\displaystyle \text{C}$) with an adjustment factor, called the **activity coefficient** ($\gamma$). 

$\displaystyle \text{a} = \text{γC}$

So, if the concentration ($\displaystyle C$, also denoted here below with square brackets [ ]) of all the dissolved species of interest are sufficiently low and that their activity coefficients are close to unity, their chemical activities can be approximated by their concentrations as commonly done when simplifying, or idealizing, a reaction for didactic purposes:

${\displaystyle Q_{r}={\frac {a_{\text{reduction}}}{a_{\text{oxidation}}}}={\frac {[\operatorname {Reductant} ]}{[\operatorname {Oxidant} ]}}}$


At chemical equilibrium, the ratio $\text{Q}_\text{r}$ of the activity of the reaction product ($\text{a}_\text{reduction}$) by the reagent activity ($\text{a}_\text{oxidation}$) is equal to the equilibrium constant K of the half-reaction:

${\displaystyle K={\frac {a_{\text{reduction}}}{a_{\text{oxidation}}}}}$

The standard thermodynamics also says that the actual Gibbs free energy $\displaystyle \Delta G$ is related to the free energy change under standard state $\displaystyle \Delta G^\ominus$ by the relationship:

${\displaystyle \Delta G=\Delta G^{\ominus }+RT\ln Q_{r}}$

## Nernst Equation

The half-cell standard reduction potential ${\displaystyle E_{\text{reduction}}^{\ominus }}$ is given by:

$\displaystyle E_{\text{reduction}}^{\ominus }\text{(V)}=-{\frac {\Delta G^{\ominus }}{nF}}$,

where ${\displaystyle \Delta G^{\ominus }}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\displaystyle n$ is the number of electrons involved and $\displaystyle F$ is Faraday's constant.

${\displaystyle E_{\text{reduction}}=E_{\text{reduction}}^{\ominus }-\frac{\text{RT}}{\text{nF}}\text{Q}_\text{r}}$

Since the Ner

$\displaystyle \text{Q}_\text{r} = \text{ln}(\frac{\alpha_\text{reduction}}{\alpha_\text{oxidation}}) = \frac{\text{[Reductant]}}{\text{[Oxidant]}}$
$\displaystyle \alpha$ is the chemical activity, which is the chemical potential multiplied by the activity coefficient to compensate for non-ideal behaviour (deviation from [[Raoult's Law]]).
