The standard electrode potential ($\text{E}^\ominus$) is expressed as the *reduction potential*. The electrochemical potential difference of a cell is then given as:

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{cell} = \text{E}^\ominus_\text{cathode} - \text{E}^\ominus_\text{anode}$

However, the potential of the reaction at the anode is \*sometimes\* expressed as an _oxidation potential_:

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{oxidation} = -\text{E}^\ominus_\text{reduction}$

The oxidation potential is a measure of the tendency of the reducing agent to be oxidized but does not represent the physical potential at an electrode. With this notation, the cell voltage equation is written with a plus sign.

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{cell} = \text{E}^\ominus_\text{oxidation} + \text{E}^\ominus_\text{reduction}$
