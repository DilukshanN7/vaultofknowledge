They don't always provide proofs for mathematical formulae, or rigorous formulas for physical observations. Nevertheless, they were good philosophical observations that did have a lot of meaning aside from just voodoo.
# Vedas
The Baudhaayana Shulba Sutras of the Tattiriya Shaakha, of Krisha Yajur Veda had aphorisms on the following mathematical theorems:

1. Pythagorean Theorem
	- **Reference:** Baudhaayana Shulba Sutra > Verses 1-2
	- **Sanskrit:**
		- दीर्घचतुरस्रस्याक्ष्णया रज्जुः पार्श्वमानी तिर्यग् मानी
		  च यत् पृथग् भूते कुरूतस्तदुभयं करोति ॥
	- **Transliteration:**
		- deergha chatursrasyaakshanayaa rajjuh paarshvamaanee, tiryagmaanee,
		  cha yatprthagbhoote kurutastadubhayaan karoti.
	- **Translation:**
		- The diagonal of an oblong produces by itself both the areas which the two sides of the oblong produce separately.
2. Digits of $\pi$
	- It was calculated as $(\frac{6}{2+\sqrt{2}})^2 = 3.088311...$ (no decimal points right)
	- They tried to use some patterns, but indeed, $\pi$ is irrational.
3. Circling the Square and Squaring the Circle
