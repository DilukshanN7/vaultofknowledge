Akrasia (/əˈkreɪziə/; Greek ἀκρασία, "lacking command" or "weakness", occasionally transliterated as acrasia or Anglicised as acrasy or acracy) is a lack of mental strength or willpower, or the tendency to act against one's better judgment.

It is sometimes translated into English as **incontinence** ("a want of continence or self-restraint")
