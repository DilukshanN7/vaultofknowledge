> 
> ==6.4.1   The earth is the essence of all these beings, water the essence of the earth, herbs of water, flowers of herbs, fruits of flowers, man of fruits, and the seed of man.==

> This section describes traditional rites to be performed to produce the desired offspring. 
> It has been explained more fully at the beginning of the previous section (section three) that these last sections of the Upanishad are from Smriti. The purpose of this final section of Smriti is to explain the rites to obtain a son to ones desire.
> A student of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad will understand the duality and delusion of desire within material creation that these verses display.   That is their very purpose.

> [!abstract] Context
> The Smriti is saying it should be the need for children that brings husband and wife together.  
> The reality of Advaita transcends the purpose of this knowledge.

> 
> The reality of Advaita-Vedanta, nonduality, transcends the purpose of this knowledge.

> > 6.4.8   If she is willing, he should proceed, uttering the following Mantra: 'I transmit reputation into you,' and they both become reputed.
