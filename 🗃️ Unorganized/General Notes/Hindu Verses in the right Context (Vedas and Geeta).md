While there is stupidity in Hindu verses, it is not as much as what goes into Islam's Ahadeeth for example.

I'll only consider the Vedas and Geeta in this section.

**Claim: "If she is not willing to give her body, he should buy her over; and if she is still unyielding, he should strike her with a stick or with the hand and proceed" - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.4.7**

**Truth:** This portion of the Upanishad is firstly a Smriti Ritual, which is not of value considering the essence of Advaita Vedanta. This is also described by Adi Shankara's commentary at the beginning of Brihadarnyaka Upanishad (didn't add here).

## Text from Kenneth Jaques Advaita Vedanta Philosophy Ashram

### Section 4

> **Section 4.**
> 
> ==6.4.1   The earth is the essence of all these beings, water the essence of the earth, herbs of water, flowers of herbs, fruits of flowers, man of fruits, and the seed of man.==
> 
> This section describes traditional rites to be performed to produce the desired offspring. 
> 
> **It has been explained more fully at the beginning of the previous section (section three)** that these last sections of the Upanishad are from Smriti. The purpose of this final section of Smriti is to explain the rites to obtain a son to ones desire.
> 
> A student of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad will understand the duality and delusion of desire within material creation that these verses display. That is their very purpose. It follows therefore that the actual meaning within these verses is not the relevance of their inclusion here. Their relevance is to highlight by contrast the transcendent Realisation of Advaita.
### Section 3

> **Section 3.**
> 
> The final two sections of verses in the Upanishad are from Smriti. The rites to be described relate to the previous sections of this chapter in that those sections described the path of rebirth that the practice of rites would lead to. hear are described such rites to realise the desire for a son. The understanding is that the desire for a son is the desire to continue to live within Creation through the further creation of a son. This desire will win the father the world, that is rebirth into the Creation cycle. Their relevance to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in general is in their devotion to the vital force. This section explains the rites (the Mantha) to perform to gain greatness and prosperity which will empower him to perform the higher rites detailed in section four in order to gain a son to his desire.
> 
> The intention of the Brihadaranyaka Sruti is to highlight the enslavement to material desire through the delusion of duality that devotion to the concept of vital force and material understanding leads to.
> 
> It follows that the rites and rituals described within the thirteen verses of this section and also the verses of the next section do not in themselves have relevance to the purpose or higher meaning of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.
> 
> The aspirant who through practice is guided by Buddhi will be further reminded of the love and reality of the Non-Dual Absolute upon seeing the contrast between the higher reality of Advaita and the duality of purpose displayed here. This is the meaning.
> 
> But it should be remembered that the Smriti represents guidance for the virtuous. the Smriti is Hindu Dharma and the very act of devotion to its way leads to purification and higher awareness.
> 
> But the highest achievement of Self Realisation and emancipation from the Creation cycle is only achieved through renunciation and meditation which is the purpose of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Sruti.
> 
> Until one overcomes this ignorance of duality and finds his or her way to the realisation of the Self they will not find everlasting peace and freedom.

> 
> The reality of Advaita-Vedanta, nonduality, transcends the purpose of this knowledge.
