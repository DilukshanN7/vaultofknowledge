**Claim: If she is not willing, he should buy her over; and if she is still unyielding, he should strike her with a stick or with the hand and proceed.**

**Truth: **

The Smriti is saying it should be the need for children that brings husband and wife together.  
The reality of Advaita transcends the purpose of this knowledge.

> **7.** If she is not willing, he should buy her over; and if she is still unyielding, he should strike her with a stick or with the hand and proceed, uttering the following Mantra, 'I take away your reputation,' etc. She is then actually discredited.

The reality of Advaita-Vedanta, nonduality, transcends the purpose of this knowledge.

> 6.4.8 Â  If she is willing, he should proceed, uttering the following Mantra: 'I transmit reputation into you,' and they both become reputed.
