- Differential Cabling, not to be confused with [[Differential Signalling]].


- Unbalanced Line
	- Pair of conductors to carry signals which have unequal impedances along their lengths and to ground and other circuits
	- Examples: Coaxial Cable, Earth Return Telegraph 
- Balanced Line
	- Pair of conductors to carry signals which have equal impedances along their lengths and to ground and other circuits
	- It reduces common-mode noise and interference when fed to a differential device such as a transformer or differential amplifier
	- Examples: Twin-Lead, Twisted Pair Cable (reduces EM radiation from crosstalk)

- Twisted Pair Cable may be shielded for additional noise immunity - Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) and Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cables

- Coaxial Cables were described by the [[Telegrapher's equations]], used in [[Submarine Telecommunication Cables]]
