- Unbalanced Line
	- Pair of conductors to carry signals which have unequal impedances along their lengths and to ground and other circuits
	- Examples: Coaxial cable, Earth Return Telegraph 
- Balanced Line
	- Pair of conductors to carry signals which have equal impedances along their lengths and to ground and other circuits
	- It reduces common-mode noise and interference when fed to a differential device such as a transformer or differential amplifier
	- It eliminates common-mode noise because it has equal impedances (how?)
	- Examples: Twin-lead, Twisted Pair cable (reduces EM radiation from crosstalk)

# Notes
- Twisted Pair cable may be shielded for additional noise immunity - Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) and Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) cables
- Coaxial cables were described by the [[Telegrapher's equations]], used in [[Transatlantic submarine telecommunication cables]].
- Balanced lines are not to be confused with [[differential signalling]], which is a [[Signalling Schemes|signalling scheme]].
