_"People who reject Hadeeth are those who lack knowledge in Hadeeth"_ 
_"If Allaah have not blessed this ummmah with any science except Usool al Hadeeth, then this will be sufficient as a proof for Islaam"_ 

Subhanallaah, these are some of the amazing quotes regarding study of Usool al Hadeeth. Usool al Hadeeth, without a doubt, is a science came to protect this deen. After all they say "No one’s life history has been protected like that of the Prophet (sallalahualayhi wasallaam)" Alhamdulillaah, the credit goes again to Usool al Hadeeth.

In studying this noble science with [KIU](http://www.kiu.org/website), I made some notes taking from the classes of Shaykh Shafiq Flynn (Hafidhahullaah). I am posting here in two parts.

## Chapter 10: Ilm Jarh wa ta’deel (Criticism and Praise)

2. We are working within the framework of Qur’aan and Sunnah 
3. Process of Qiyaas will make subtle haram more apparent. It is not creation of Hukm rather systematic tool to make subtleties clear

A. Definition of Naskh: 
a. Linguistic Meaning: 
i. Remove/get away (22:52) 
ii. To Transfer/Copy (45:29)

i. It is to remove legal injunction by legal evidence that comes later (after the original Hukm) 
ii. Exceptions: 
1. It is not merely any legal text rather Hukm 
2. It is not Takhsees (Specification) 
3. One who can abrogate is Allaah and not anyone 
iii. Example: 
1. Abrogation of Hadeeth recording in writing after fear is removed that Qur’aan will mix with the hadeeth 
B. Condition of Abrogating text:

2 Takshsees can take place by Daleel Aql (logical evidence) Naskh take place by Naql 
3 Takhsees not necessarily need to be a later Hukm Naskh must be a later Hukm 
4 Takhsees gives explanation of earlier text Naskh does away with the earlier text 
b. Taqyeed (Restriction) 
i. No conflict with original text 
ii. Can happen initial or later 
iii. It will not do away with original Hukm rather just restricts 
c. Bad’aa 
i. Making something apparent (39:47) 
ii. New opinion is presented when there is no initial idea (12:35 – knowledge of something which was not once there) 
iii. It is known according to circumstance 
iv. It is to do away with the text 
v. Bad’aa comes from created being whereas Naskh comes from Allaah alone as it undermines Allaah of perfect Knowledge 
D. Manifestation in Hadeeth Science 
a. Mutawattir abrogated by Mutawattir 
b. Mutawattir abrogated by Ahad

1. Jabir said "last of deeds of Prophet whether to take wudoo from water changed by…" 
ii. Fails to explain which text is Naskh 
1. Opinion 1: Sahaabah may be practicing Ijtihaad and not an authority by itself 
2. Opinion 2: Naskh happens only Naql so Sahaabah cannot make their own Naskh 
3. Opinion 3: It is acceptable when there is some supporting evidence that conflicts with the Mansookh 
Chapter 13: Ilm at-Ta’aarud waTarjeeh (Conflict and Preference) 
A. Declaration: Two sound hadeeth will not contradict each other as both are from Allaah 
B. T’a’aarud or Alman’aa (Prevention/conflict) 
a. Muhadeeth call it as Mukhtaliful Hadeeth

1 "Ikhtilaaf" means contradiction "Ishkaal" means confusion 
2 Only conflict It could include Mukhtalif and may also contradict the Qur’aan 
3 Meaning will be clear absurdity in the language due to use of Majaz (metaphor) and others 
4 we go for 3 ways to resolve other evidences are sorted out to explain the intention of the statement 
G. Qualities of Taa’rud 
a. Tadaad : opposite 
b. Authority: Of same authority 
H. Ta’aarud al Haqeeqe (Real conflict) doesn’t take place in Qur’aan & Sunnah (Jamhoor) 
a. Sunnah is nothing but Wahy (53:3,4 | 21:45) 
b. If it is from other than Allaah, you would have found contradictions (4:72) 
c. Takleef: Man cannot do two opposite orders at the same time 
d. It implies ignorance of Allaah. Subhanallaah 
e. Why do we have Naskh and Tarjeeh? These Tools indicate that real conflict will never take place 
I. Reasons why conflict appears: (Imam Shafi’ee) 
a. Regarding Narrator: 
i. Lack of Memorization: Narrator asks question to Prophet but he memorize answer alone. (eg.: Hadeeth of Ubaadah ibn Samit. Prohibited sale of something for its value) 
ii. Question of Adaa: How narrator delivers hadeeth (Hadeeth on engagement. Engage somebody already engaged and about permission) 
b. Ignorance of Language and its usages 
i. Knowledge of Aam and Khaas is important 
ii. Eg.: "From a Muslim, his fellow Muslim’s honor and blood are protected." It seems conflicting with the hadeeth "Neighbour is not permitted to stop his neighbour to plant trees in his property" First one is general and second one is specific 
iii. Eg.: "Whoever changes religion, person should be put to death". In another hadeeth, Prophet prohibited killing of women. Here it is Tahsees (Particularization) 
c. Ignorance of Naskh 
d. Ignorance about changes in circumstances and environment 
J. How to deal with Ta’aarud? (Order of Approach) 
a. Jamhoor (All Madh-hab and portion of Ahnaf) 
i. Jam 
ii. Tarjeeh 
iii. Naskh 
iv. Tawaquf (Stop and leave it as they are) 
v. Choose one over another – Dangerous as it may imply naskh by us 
vi. Al Baraa al Asliyah (Going to permission first: Origin of everything is permissible) – Dangerous as we may make something haram as halal 
b. Hanafee 
i. Naskh 
ii. Tarjeeh 
iii. At Tasakut (Leave both of the hadeeth rather search for other hadeeth) 
1. In terms of tawaquf, we stop and don’t search for other text 
iv. Search for Asl 
v. Jam (Combination of various hadeeth) 
1. Strange: Jam helps in respecting both authorities so this should be the preference 
2. Hanfee claim Sahaabahs engaged in Tarjeeh first before others 
K. Conclusions: 
a. These conflicts are apparent and not real. 
b. Apparent conflict appears mostly due to lack of skill 
Chapter 14: Tarjeeh Discourse (Ways of Preference) 
A. Definition: 
a. Linguistic: Preference, weightier 
b. Technical: 
i. Explanation of the Mujtahid of the extra strength in one of the zanee evidences that are contradicting each other which he tried to combine 
ii. Mujtahid: 
1. Consideration of the necessary information ( Aware of sciences of hadeeth, jarh wa ta’deel, Fiqh, usool and so on) 
2. its acceptability 
3. the correct method of investigation is observed

Appendix B: Sciences of Hadeeth as critical apparatus in preserving Hadeeth 
"If Allaah have not given any science to this Ummah except Uloom al Hadeeth, it is sufficient as a proof for Islaam" 
Islaam is the religion which is blessed with number of sciences. Among it, Uloom al Hadeeth has different branches of sciences which preserves the Hadeeth of the Prophet for more than 1400 years and will preserve it till the day of Judgement. 

Though Uloom al hadeeth is rich with ample amount of sciences , it can be categorized as follows 

A. Broader Sciences: 
a. Any Hadeeth is comprised basically of two components 
i. Isnaad (Chain) 
ii. Matn (Text) 
b. The science which deals with Chains and scrutinize it from different angles with different tools to confirm its origin is called Ilmud Diraayah 
c. The Science which studies reality/original text of the hadeeth from different dimensions to give practical implication in our life is called Ilmur Riwayah 
d. There are certain sciences which absorbs both the above mentioned sciences in giving different benefits such as Ta’aarud wa tarjeeh which deals with chain and text in terms of preference when there is apparent conflict 
e. Now let us see how each science played a role of critical apparatus 

B. Ilmud Diraayah (Testing the Chain) 
a. Ilm Tahammul al Hadeeth (Process of Transmission) 
i. This Science with very precise wordings such as Haddathna, Akhbarna indicates to the reader how the hadeeth was received or transmitted 
ii. Further this science indicates certainty which helps in deriving ahkam in addition to the demonstration of Historical evolution of that particular hadeeth 
b. Ilm Rijaal al Hadeeth/Asmaa ar Rijaal (History of the narrator) 
i. In the due course of transmission process, there developed an science Asmaa ar Rijaal, which captured the historical background of the one who narrates the hadeeth from birth to death, character to manners and so on to the effect of history of the Rawi (narrator). 
ii. This helped in protecting the credibility of authentic chains of the hadeeth 
c. Ilm Jarh wa ta’deel (Condition of the narrator) 
i. With the help of knowledge from Rijaal al Hadeeth, Jarh wa ta’deel helped in scrutinizing the chain from the perspective of the narrator whether he is the praised one (ta’deel) or he is dispraised (Jarh) 
ii. This dictates conditions of the narrator 
iii. Oldest name of this science is Naqd al Hadeeth 
d. Ilm Mustalah al Hadeeth (Principles of Hadeeth) 
i. This is really a usool of Hadeeth which gives the comprehensive information about Hadeeth with the help of terminologies 
ii. This Science clarifies the following 
1. From where the hadeeth is originated? eg.: Qudsi, Marfu 
2. How good the link between the levels (Tabaqat)? eg.: Musnad, Mursal 
3. How many narrators involved in the transmission? eg.: Mutawattir, Ahad 
4. What is the nature of the text and the Isnaad? eg.: Musnad, Mudraj 
5. What is the reliability level and memory of the narrator? eg.: Sahih, Da’eef 
iii. Greatest benefit of this science is that it gives us the Hukm of the hadeeth whether we have to accept or reject 

C. Ilmur Riwayah (Testing the Text) 
a. Ilm Mukhtalifal Hadeeth (Handling Conflict) 
i. After Hadeeth is confirmed with the help of sciences of Riwayah that it is truly the hadeeth from the Prophet, then focus is turned to text of the hadeeth 
ii. Mukhtalifal Hadeeth informs us how one should handle when there is apparent conflict between two authentic hadeeth 
iii. Tools this Science provides for resolution are as follows: 
1. Can we combine two hadeeth? – Jam 
2. If not, Can we prefer one hadeeth over the other? – Tarjeeh 
3. If not, Check whether any of the hadeeth was abrogated? – Naskh 
iv. This Science helps saves us from the greatest sin of rejection of Hadeeth and derives benefit of the hadeeth 
b. Ilm Ghareeb al Hadeeth (Strange words are no more strange) 
i. This science helps one to understand the strange words in the hadeeth and helps in studying the hadeeth from linguistic dimension for proper understanding 
c. Ilm Naasikh wa Mansookhi 
i. This science helps in deriving the legislation of the hadeeth and demonstrates how hadeeth also followed Qur’aans gradual way of legislation and bringing/abrogating law based on needs and necessities 
ii. This informs us which hadeeth abrogates which hadeeth and so on 
d. Fiqh al Hadeeth (Ruling from the Hadeeth) 
i. This science tries to compile all the hadeeth that are relevant for Fiqh rulings such as the books of Abu Yusuf, Abu Dawood, A’laam al-Muwaqqi’een of Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah and others 
ii. This science ultimately gives the fruit of the hadeeth 

D. Both Diraayah and Riwayah 
After studying the Isnaad and text from different dimensions, there are certain sciences which studies in combination of text and chain and gives us numerous benefits 
a. Ilm Ilal Hadeeth (Microscopic Lens)
