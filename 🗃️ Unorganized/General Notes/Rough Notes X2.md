# Innocent Muslim Claims

## Islam respects other religions

## Islam only commands Jihad against those who broke treaties

- Example 1: Interpretation of 2:190
	- **Source:** https://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/69041/what-is-the-interpretation-of-quran-2190
		- Views vary on whether 2:190 is abrogated.
		- But when it is, transgression is about killing women, children and disabled men, and depending on the Madhhab, monks and old men.
		- "Fight those who fight you" is an interpretation, but fighting those who do not fight you is not forbidden.
		- "Kindness is not forbidden", as it is said.

## Islam doesn't condone slavery

## Aisha wasn't 9

## Hadiths aren't valid
