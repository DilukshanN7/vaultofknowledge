# Innocent Muslim Claims

## Islam respects other religions

## Islam only commands Jihad against those who broke treaties

- Example 1: Interpretation of 2:190
	- **Source:** https://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/69041/what-is-the-interpretation-of-quran-2190
		- Views vary on whether 2:190 is abrogated.

		- For example, this does not address the question of whether Muslims initiated the war or not
		- The conditions of a "peace treaty" is questionable, once you read the Tafsir of Ibn Kathir on 9:29
			- There, the treaty seemed so submissive, as if it was written at gunpoint
			- This is the reference example of the nature of a treaty post the Conquest of Mecca
			- Also, that example was of Dhimmah, and it is in line with the verse that says that the Dhimmis should be taxed under the knowledge of their humiliation under the rule of Islam
	- A moderate interpretation of this is that not all disbelievers are to be killed, but only
