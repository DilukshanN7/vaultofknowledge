I FINALLY FOUND IT FROM SAHEEH AL-BUKHARI (They hid it in Arabic)

- Sahih al-Bukhari Book 56: Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad)
	- Chapter 6: بَابُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ وَصِفَتُهُنَّ (Al-Hur-ul-'Ein Wasifatuhuna, "Beautiful Eyed Maidens and their description")
		- Description 1: يَحَارُ فِيهَا الطَّرْفُ شَدِيدَةُ سَوَادِ الْعَيْنِ شَدِيدَةُ بَيَاضِ الْعَيْنِ (The gaze is dazzled by them, their eyes are very black, their eyes are very white)
		- Description 2: {وَزَوَّجْنَاهُمْ} أَنْكَحْنَاهُمْ. ({And We married them} We married them)
