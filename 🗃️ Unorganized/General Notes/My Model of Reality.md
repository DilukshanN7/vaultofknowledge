Similar to Sankhya, but different.

Instead of one Purusha, I consider Brahman divides into Purusha and Sthree. Brahman is one, but its aspects are dual, and hence the two are dual, yet one. This is just like how water has oxygen and hydrogen, and both give different properties, yet water is one. And they are always addressed as they.

Then they create a common world, which is like a dream, but not exactly, because it is a shared world. They create a nature that adheres to certain rules temporarily, to explore it playfully.

This is because infinity cannot be reduced to determinism, and thus they explore different worlds and possibilities.

The worlds are created with a feminine and masculine aspects, each of them controlling one. So when beings reproduce, the offsprings are created with a compromise on how much of each characteristics they get, and if one remains predominant.

And most living beings are controlled by one of them, while the others appear to be sentient, but are only part of the world. All beings are not conscious themselves even though they have minds, and only have as much control over their lives as a child who plays with a toy steering wheel matching the turns his dad makes with the real steering wheel has on a car. That is, God controls.
