The standard model is based off the Yangs-Mill theory.

For predictions of [[Quantum Field Theory|QFT]] to match experimental data, the particles have to acquire mass, and this has to be done externally, and we had come up with the [[Higgs Mechanism]].

Together, [[Quantum Chromodynamics|QCD]], [[Electroweak Theory|EWT]] and the [[Higgs Mechanism]] describes all fundamental behaviour except gravity.
