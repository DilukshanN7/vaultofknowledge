# Castes

The word Dheevara is of Sanskrit origin, and has been used to describe fishermen in Gautama Dharmasutra and Mahabharata.

The Dheevara community was formed by Arayan, Valan and other castes to lobby for the fishers' rights, and to seek caste-based reservations in government jobs.

The members of the community formed "Akhila Kerala Dheevara Sabha"(AKDS) and Dheevara Mahasabha ("Dheevara Great Assembly"), which are politically powerful organizations.

The Hindu fisherfolk worship Bhagavati and Kali. Convert to Christianity and Muslim from the fisher castes are grouped under Dheevara.
# Who are dalits
Dalits = Outcastes = Scheduled Castes (SCs) = Avarnas (Outside the caste-system)

Scheduled Tribes (STs) = Adivasis (No link to the caste-system)

Other Backward Castes (OBCs) = Shudras (Placed at the 4th or the bottom tier of the caste-system)
# Dalits in Hinduism

Here are just a few examples of prominent personages in Indian culture and history who in today's context would be termed 'Shudra' or 'Dalit.' or ‘Backward’

1. Valli - the consort of God Karthikeya, son of Shiva - belonged to a mountain (forest) tribe
2. Sage Valmiki - the Adi Kavi and author of Ramayana - was a forest tribal and a dacoit.
3. Veda Vyasa - author of the Mahabharatha. the cataloger of the Vedas , the progenitor of the Kauravas and the Pandavas - was the son of a fisherwoman Satyawati, and Sage Parasara
4. Chandragupta Maurya - founder of the Mauryan Empire and grandfather of Ashoka - believed to have belonged to the fringe tribe of the Mayuras / or the illegitimate son of a Nanda prince and a maid
5. Thiruvalluvar - arguably the greatest Tamil saint belonged to the weaver community.
6. Several saints - Namadeva (weaver), Tukaram (Kunbi) Kanakadasa (kuruba) Nammalvar (cultivator) Nandanar (Pulaya) Ravidas (chamar and guru of Mirabai) several Shaivaite and Vaishnavaite saints inc. from the Alwars and Nayanmars...to mention just a miniscule few.

Need I say more?? One cannot have more illustrious ancestors than the above surely?

In fact there are 100s and 1000s of them. It was more the norm than the exception. The earlier we go into Indian history and pre-history, the more there are! What does this tell us? The inference is obvious.


# How did Caste come

Socio-cultural-linguistic changes brought about by the Aryans to Indian subcontinent

1. Introduction of [Chariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot "en.wikipedia.org") and [Domestication of the horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse "en.wikipedia.org") are (not present in Indus Valley Civilization) - [Ashvamedha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashvamedha "en.wikipedia.org")- referred to in epics - Ramayana and Mahabharata points to conquest of land using the ‘horse’ as the symbol of power. The origins can be traced back to Central Asia.
- Depictions of war between races in Hindu literature - Hindu puranas are full of depictions of war between - [Deva (Hinduism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism) "en.wikipedia.org"), [Asura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura "en.wikipedia.org"), [Rakshasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshasa "en.wikipedia.org")- and other ‘demon’ kings. If these were just wars between similar looking people, then these would have described differently (like Ashoka went to war with Kalinga). This is clearly evidence of ‘racial’ conflict in Indian subcontinent.
- Introduction of Indo-European languages - Sanskrit being the language of the victors and most caste literature originates from this language points to the fact that caste system was introduced by this event. Sanskrit being one of first written languages to refer to the caste system.
- Vedic literature - The original Vedic literature does not have references to caste or varna. It was believed to have been added by later to justify the caste system. Refer to the discussion of [Varna (Hinduism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism) "en.wikipedia.org")and [Purusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha "en.wikipedia.org").
- [Puranic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas "en.wikipedia.org")- literature of later origin liberally supports the ideas of birth based caste system. Marking the formalization of the caste system.
- [Manu Smriti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Smriti "en.wikipedia.org")and [Arthashastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra "en.wikipedia.org") also refer to the caste system showing that the caste system was accorded legal and religious sanction.


There is no evidence for the following

1. Caste system was ‘originally’ based on professions. There would have been uniform intermixing of castes - unlike the asymmetric gene-flow like between populations between ANI/ASI. The Sanskrit term for caste, Chaturvarna literally means four-color. Long list of [Gotra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotra "en.wikipedia.org") (clans) shows that it was based on birth right from its origins.
- Caste is different from varna mentioned in literature. The fracturing of varna system to finer divisions owing to the development of different professions over a period of time is rational explanation of various castes as the varna’s differentiation continued in the ‘Jati’ system as well.
- Caste was created by British to divide India. This is laughable because the reference to caste is much older than the British rule of India. It has been referred to in Greek and Chinese traveler accounts of India. No one in academic circles takes this seriously. The British meticulously documented various castes and tribes of India. The caste system itself was a local creation.
- Everybody was equal in ancient India. The DNA evidence clearly suggests the asymmetric relationship between castes. Literally every Purana suggests the existence of a hierarchical caste system.
- Horse was present in Indus Valley Civilization. While there were bones detected they are suspected to be of that of donkeys, rather than horses. There is no evidence of its domestication in IVC - [Bit (horse)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_(horse) "en.wikipedia.org"), [Stirrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirrup "en.wikipedia.org"), [Saddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle "en.wikipedia.org") or [Chariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot "en.wikipedia.org"). The wearing of the premolar teeth is considered as the evidence of domestication of horse. There is no evidence of this. (Read more: [Domestication of the horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse "en.wikipedia.org")).
- Trading contacts resulted in the asymmetric mixing of European genes. This is unlikely unless the trade was some form of slavery. Few silk traders leaving their marks on people of entire subcontinent is not backed by evidence. If this was true, the Chinese would have the same genes as well. The silk trade was with them as well.

When dealing with topic, one has to look at scientific evidence instead of the deliberate misinterpretations and selective reading of vedic literature. This comes from those who see these evidence as a threat to their legitimacy. This has to be taken with a pinch of salt.

British revived the Manu Smriti?

Shudra only really appears in the Purusha Pustaka of Vedas?
