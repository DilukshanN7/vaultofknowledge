# Castes

The word Dheevara is of Sanskrit origin, and has been used to describe fishermen in Gautama Dharmasutra and Mahabharata.

The Dheevara community was formed by Arayan, Valan and other castes to lobby for the fishers' rights, and to seek caste-based reservations in government jobs.

The members of the community formed "Akhila Kerala Dheevara Sabha"(AKDS) andDheevara Mahasabha ("Dheevara Great Assembly"), which are politically powerful organizations.
