This is because poetry depends on one to understand shared feelings.

Poetry is used to convey feelings.
And it can only do so 

Now, poetry can be used to convey meaning.
However, it can only be done by a very deep dissection of ideas.
That is, because poetry can only convey shared feelings.
However, one that does such a thing will often be repelled by poetry.
This is because poetry is not a medium of logic, it is merely one of feelings.
That is to say statements are discrete and can be analyzed, but poetry is fluid.

Also for this reason, those who find meaning from poetry are those who fall for beautiful lies.
