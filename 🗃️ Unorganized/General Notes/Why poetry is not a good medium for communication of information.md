This is because poetry depends on one to understand shared feelings.

And poetry is only used to convey feelings.
## Conveying Meaning
Now, poetry can be used to convey meaning.
However, it can only be done by a very deep dissection of ideas.
That is, because poetry can only convey shared feelings.
And feelings on the surface may be corrupt, but the deeper feelings contain one's humanity.
However, one that does such a thing will often be repelled by the idea of using poetry.
This is because poetry is not a medium of logic, it is merely one of feelings.
That is to say statements are discrete and can be analyzed, but poetry is fluid.

Also for this reason, those who find meaning from poetry are those who fall for beautiful lies.
And in case of hate incitement, this is not even a matter of intellect, but simply one of morality.
Improper use of intellect may cause a person to believe that certain arbitrary patterns have deep meaning.
However, to cause a person to hate someone, the person himself should have the roots of hate in him.

But even this doesn't mean that such a person is evil.
For example, one may hate womanizers because they think monogamy is bad.
But that is according to their culture, and people of other cultures may be living under different frameworks.
This is of the same idea that, the right means used by the wrong person will work in wrong ways.
To give another example, a Jew may think that all polytheists sacrifice their babies to idols.
However, he may end up seeing a polytheist community that does not have any such rituals.
By this observation, the Jew will then be able to know that polytheism and sacrifice are two separate ideas.
However, if is only taught to obey an order, and not question it's rationale, then he will not think in this manner.
