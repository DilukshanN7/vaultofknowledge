I often have this problem where I start writing about something, and then.. all of a sudden, I get two perspectives on it at the same time. (I hope I won't get it now - I just did, however, that's the less problematic version of it). Now you would say that I could represent one thought in detail first, then the other. But there's a problem. Here we go:

Context: I get two ideas that I could expand on. Flow 1 and 2.

### Result
This doesn't seem problematic right away, you could finish one point and move on to the next.
