Wine, formerly WINE, originally stood for "WINE Is Not an Emulator".

It is a compatibility layer which allows running Windows applications on other operating systems such as Unices, Haiku, etc.

As the original name implies, it is not an emulator, but rather, a layer that translates the Windows [[Application Binary Interface|ABI]] into the host system ABI.
