Wine, formerly WINE, originally stood for "WINE Is Not an Emulator".

It is a compatibility layer which allows running Windows applications on other operating systems such as UNIX systems, Haiku, etc.

As the original name implies, it is not an emulator, but rather, a layer that translates the Windows [[Application Binary Interface|ABI]] into the host system ABI.

An [[emulators|emulator]] is a program that virtually creates a system, on which a program runs. That is, rather than translating system calls which get eventually passed on to a kernel, the entire machine is implemented as software. Only the instruction set architecture is emulated by the host kernel, but any application running within the emulator has nothing to do with the host kernel.

Similar to this is a [[Virtualization|virtualizer]], which is a program that does not create a machine, but 

It is similar to running a 32 bit binary on a 64 bit kernel.
