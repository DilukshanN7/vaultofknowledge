> What if charges are not what they seem? What if rather than looking at electric fields separately, maybe charges are simply the aspect of the electromagnetic field that binds it in place, which is why the non-binding aspect of the field does not look like a sink or a source. That makes sense with seeing how electric fields and magnetic field values can vary according to the chosen inertial frame of reference; or in the other sense, for a specific inertial reference frame, the field values vary according to the flow of fields.

- We all know about electron flow
- But what is this electron that flows?
- Moving electric charge creates a magnetic field around it
- That is because changing electric field creates a magnetic field
- Electric charges are just sinks or sources in the electric field
- That, is further due to spacetime warping due to the energy flow causing a charge variation
- (The fields just like to be neutral, so it is like something was taken away)
- Since a voltage moves electrons at a drift velocity, the rate at which the electric field flows is constant
- Since changing electric fields create a magnetic field, the magnetic field itself does not change when the rate of change is constant (that is, after the electric field flow rate has settled, and the magnetic field has risen in proportion)
- If we then change the rate of change of the electric fields, we get a change in the magnetic field.
- That is, changing the velocity of a moving electric charge, by accelerating it
- We can achieve this in one way increasing the voltage repeatedly (since drift velocity depends on the voltage)
- Or we can simply generate alternating current, where the electrons keep changing velocities forwards and backwards
- Since the change in electric field keeps changing, the subsequent magnetic field also keeps changing, and it further generates a change in electric field, and this

That is, if we choose a different reference frame, a charged particle was still in motion. The measured electric and magnetic fields may change around that region of space, but the electromagnetic field won't as it is a tensor describing the complete field state, regardless of the inertial frame of reference used.

This is because the speed of light is simply the speed at which changes flow. For example, the speed of sound is the speed at which the disturbance in water propagates.

**Lie:** Moving electric charges create a magnetic field around them

**Truth:** Moving charges don't create field change around them

Applying newton's first law: All things are in a state of rest or uniform motion unless an external force is applied.

Now, this rest is only within a frame of reference. The same body can be seen as moving with a constant velocity from another inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference, even though the body's state of motion wasn't altered by any force.

In other words, the magnitude of the magnetic field is proportional to the velocity of the charge.

**Wild thoughts**
So if I move myself, I see the charge as producing a field, although it is my eyes which are fooling me into thinking so
That is an ever-present illusion of the universe, right?
