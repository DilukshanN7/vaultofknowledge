> What if charges are not what they seem? What if rather than looking at electric fields separately, maybe charges are simply the aspect of the electromagnetic field that binds it in place, which is why the non-binding aspect of the field does not look like a sink or a source. That makes sense with seeing how electric fields and magnetic field values can vary according to the chosen inertial frame of reference; or in the other sense, for a specific inertial reference frame, the field values vary according to the flow of fields.

- We all know about electron flow
- But what is this electron that flows?
- Moving electric charge creates a magnetic field around it
- That is because changing electric field creates a magnetic field
- Electric charges are just sinks or sources in the electric field
- That, is further due to spacetime warping due to the energy flow causing a charge variation
- (The fields just like to be neutral, so it is like something was taken away)
- Since a voltage moves electrons at a drift velocity, the rate at which the electric field flows is constant
- Since changing electric fields create a magnetic field, the magnetic field itself does not change when the rate of change is constant (that is, after the electric field flow rate has settled, and the magnetic field has risen in proportion)
- Now, changing the velocity of the flow of elec
