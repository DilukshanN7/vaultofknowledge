- We all know about electron flow
- But what is this electron that flows?
- Moving electric charge creates a magnetic field around it
- That is because changing electric field creates a magnetic field
- Electric charges are just sinks or sources in the electric field
- That, is further does to spacetime warping due to the energy flow causing a charge variation
