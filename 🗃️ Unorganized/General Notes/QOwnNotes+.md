- People are so attracted to mystery, so much so that they are willing to make themselves stupid in order to feel dominated by mystery
	- For example, people find a smartphone complicated (hence, smart)
	- At the same time, they disrespect a rat-trap because it's cheap and easy to make (provided you have the springs made)
	- For the same reason, they'd find a smartphone DIY manual initially relieving, but then boring, because now they know how to make a smartphone.
	- This is the same reason why open sourcing software can be off putting to many people
	- That is, artists often demand attribution and secrecy to their recipes
	- But in reality, a deeper understanding should open the room for more curious wonders rather than limiting our scope of wonder to what little we already know

- Parable of incest
	- With mother
		- Consider two primeval parents
		- If the son claims that the bitches are mad, and tells his mother that she is responsible for him
		- Then the mother and son will have a child, and so on, until the mother dies.
		- So this is no way to sustain a civilization
	- With sister
		- With the sister, if a person only has sex with sister, then children the number of people in the world will remain fairly minimal, as there can only be so many people descending from a single family
		- The first generation will mate with each other
		- If they produce only one male and one female, they will likely continue the cycle
		- If they produce two males and two females, then the two males can still mate with the other two
		- The number of children who descend from that family line will be a multiple of the average children times the number of children in that generation
		- This is mathematically alright, but this problem cannot be addressed just as it is in the patriarchal world, because a sister can be from the father's side or the mother's side
		- After a few generations, the family lines still get distant, so it will be just like marrying a stranger
		- That would mean that incest with sisters is not that bad outside of the initial phase
		- The reason this would be bad, would only be to encourage connecting with other humans

- Taylor Swift
	- When rich people face the slightest inconvenience, they throw tantrums
	- Taylor Swift calls herself a tortured poet despite there not being a perceptible scratch to her body or soul
	- This is similar to how American teens think they live under tyranny, not because of the homelessness, but because of the taxes

- Organization of Information
	- Organize each section according to how much someone can digest at a glance
	- Don't add too many points under one point in an overview
