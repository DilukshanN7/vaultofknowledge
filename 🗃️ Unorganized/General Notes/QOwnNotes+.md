- People are so attracted to mystery, so much so that they are willing to make themselves stupid in order to feel dominated by mystery
	- For example, people find a smartphone complicated (hence, smart)
	- At the same time, they disrespect a rat-trap because it's cheap and easy to make (provided you have the springs made)
	- For the same reason, they'd find a smartphone DIY manual initially relieving, but then boring, because now they know how to make a smartphone.
	- This is the same reason why open sourcing software can be off putting to many people
	- That is, artists often demand attribution and secrecy to their recipes
	- But in reality, a deeper understanding should open the room for more curious wonders rather than limiting our scope of wonder to what little we already know

- Parable of incest
	- With mother
		- Consider two primeval parents
		- If the son claims that the bitches are mad, and tells his mother that she is responsible for him
		- Then the mother and son will have a child, and so on, until the mother dies.
		- So this is no way to sustain a civilization
	- With sister
		- With the sister, if a person only has sex with sister, then children the number of people in the world will remain fairly minimal, as there can only be so many people descending from a single family
		- The first generation will mate with each other
		- If they produce only one male and one female, they will likely continue the cycle
		- If they produce two males and two females, then the two males can still mate with the other two
		- The number of children who descend from that family line will be a multiple of the average children times the number of children in that generation
		- This is mathematically alright, but this problem cannot be addressed just as it is in the patriarchal world, because a sister can be from the father's side or the mother's side
		- After a few generations, the family lines still get distant, so it will be just like marrying a stranger
		- That would mean that incest with sisters is not that bad outside of the initial phase
		- The reason this would be bad, would only be to encourage connecting with other humans

- Taylor Swift
	- When rich people face the slightest inconvenience, they throw tantrums
	- Taylor Swift calls herself a tortured poet despite there not being a perceptible scratch to her body or soul
	- This is similar to how American teens think they live under tyranny, not because of the homelessness, but because of the taxes

- Organization of Information
	- Organize each section according to how much someone can digest at a glance
	- Don't add too many points under one point in an overview
	- Don't add too many subheadings (use a maximum of 3 levels of headings: H1-H3 or H2-H4)
	- If you need additional subsections, use overviews and bold styling

- About Respect
	- It is best to respect everyone
	- But what is the point at which we should not?
		- When the other party does not respect your rights (Remember my Personal Experience)
		- When the other party disrespects your opinions without a proper reason (according to you)
		- When the other party's opinion is harmful to them (according to you)
		- When the other party's opinion is harmful to others (according to you)
		- NOTE: 
			- Proper reason means, for example, two unprovable theories can co-exist in harmony
			- But certain unprovable theories are harmful to oneself or the others (subjectively and objectively)
			- And certain unprovable theories can seem harmful to oneself or the others (subjectively, but not objectively)

- Eliminating Self-Control and Choosing to Channel Energy
	- I wouldn't want to be controlling my "urge to rape someone", should I?
	- But at the same time, it's a good thing to do, if you do not have a better idea

- The consideration of God
	- HIV
		- This is used as an argument to point out extramarital relationships are immoral
		- I think the presence of HIV has a lot to do with lack of hygiene, and character
		- First of all, one must know the partner very well before sleeping with them
		- Secondly, one should not sleep around, treating human bodies like flesh
		- I believe HIV acts as a deterrent to these issues
		- One must have self discipline, but not to the levels of stressing oneself arbitrarily
		- One must be self-aware, and should use condoms before having casual sex
		- One must be familiar with the conditions of human nature, and get tested for HIV
		- This is not very different from maintaining hygiene and protecting oneself from 
	- The story of the Tower of Babel
		- I think a problem lay clearly in the level of maturity of the people at the time
		- They thought God was in the sky, and tried to build a large building to overpower him
		- God ended up stopping their stupidity, which would've only been a waste of time
		- Story checks out fine
			- But I think God could've just told them why it's a stupid idea
			- But I guess, the world is not a project with a progress bar after all
		- Also, they built the tower in
