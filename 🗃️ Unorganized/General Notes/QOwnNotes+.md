- People are so attracted to mystery, so much so that they are willing to make themselves stupid in order to feel dominated by mystery
	- For example, people find a smartphone complicated (hence, smart)
	- At the same time, they disrespect a rat-trap because it's cheap and easy to make (provided you have the springs made)
	- For the same reason, they'd find a smartphone DIY manual initially relieving, but then boring, because now they know how to make a smartphone.
	- This is the same reason why open sourcing software can be off putting to many people
	- That is, artists often demand attribution and secrecy to their recipes
	- But in reality, a deeper understanding should open the room for more curious wonders rather than limiting our scope of wonder to what little we already know

- Parable of incest
	- With mother
		- Consider two primeval parents
		- If the son claims that the bitches are mad, and tells his mother that she is responsible for him
		- Then the mother and son will have a child, and so on, until the mother dies.
		- So this is no way to sustain a civilization
	- With sister
		- With the sister, if a person only has sex with sister, then children the number of people in the world will remain fairly minimal, as there can only be so many people descending from a single family
		- The first generation will mate with each other
		- If they produce only one male and one female, they will likely continue the cycle
		- If they produce two males and two females, then the two males can still mate with the other two
		- The number of children who descend from that family line will be a multiple of the average children times the number of children in that generation
		- This is mathematically alright, but this problem cannot be addressed just as it is in the patriarchal world, because a sister can be from the father's side or the mother's side
		- After a few generations, the family lines still get distant, so it will be just like marrying a stranger
		- That would mean that incest with sisters is not that bad outside of the initial phase
		- The reason this would be bad, would only be to encourage connecting with other humans

- Taylor Swift
	- When rich people face the slightest inconvenience, they throw tantrums
	- Taylor Swift calls herself a tortured poet despite there not being a perceptible scratch to her body or soul
	- This is similar to how American teens think they live under tyranny, not because of the homelessness, but because of the taxes

- Organization of Information
	- Organize each section according to how much someone can digest at a glance
	- Don't add too many points under one point in an overview
	- Don't add too many subheadings (use a maximum of 3 levels of headings: H1-H3 or H2-H4)
	- If you need additional subsections, use overviews and bold styling

- About Respect
	- It is best to respect everyone
	- But what is the point at which we should not?
		- When the other party does not respect your rights (Remember my Personal Experience)
		- When the other party disrespects your opinions without a proper reason (according to you)
		- When the other party's opinion is harmful to them (according to you)
		- When the other party's opinion is harmful to others (according to you)
		- NOTE: 
			- Proper reason means, for example, two unprovable theories can co-exist in harmony
			- But certain unprovable theories are harmful to oneself or the others (subjectively and objectively)
			- And certain unprovable theories can seem harmful to oneself or the others (subjectively, but not objectively)

- Eliminating Self-Control and Choosing to Channel Energy
	- My philosophy posits ideas such as incest is not an evil action, but only a cultural taboo
	- While this is sounds outrageous, I argue that any idea that can fix this will have to be so
	- For example, every person wants to have sex, but they are reluctant to admit it
	- Here, the tradition ends up being the patriarchal model where men own "their women"
	- This way, the stronger gender of men are able to have their desires met by the contract of wedlock
	- Since men are not a monolith, many women have enjoyed harmonious relationships in this model
	- However, many women have also been subject to abuse because of this same model
	- But if any women stands against the issue, due to the patriarchal model, she is labelled as spoiled
	- And if any man stands against this issue, he is labelled as an evil person who want to prey on "our women"
	- Granted, that also comes with the patriarchal idea that "women are intellectually inferior"
	- And the aforementioned women who have enjoyed harmonious relationships will back these claims too
	- So, the traditional society is designed to ensure that any criticism will be seen as outrageous
	- What this results in is a state of existence where clear solutions exist, but everyone is afraid to point it out
	- INSERT MEME: Thomas (The Tank Engine) has never seen such bullshit before

	- To all this, I say, to hell with it
	- Let's consider the way in which people deal with the problem of rape today
	- People say that rape happens because men don't control themselves
		- (That is in addition to the stupid opinion that it is because women dress immodestly)
		- (Because women get raped regardless of what they wear, and no good man would rape)
		- (That is, rape happens not because of lust, but because of the inability to satisfy it by watching porn)
		- (This in turn is because the culture views having a girl or wife as what gives worthiness to a man)
		- (Women who present themselves as "prizes for high-value men" are equally blameworthy for this)
		- (Because of this reason, it only insecure men who take validation from society rape women)
		- (In order to fix this, we have to solve the problem of insecurity, by eliminating the root cause of fears)
		- (What women dressing immodestly according to cultural norms really does is just disturb men)
	- But I wouldn't want to be controlling my "urge to rape someone", should I?
	- But at the same time, it's a good thing to do, if you do not have a better idea
	- For this reason, I think it's better to destroy traditions, and solve the problem
	- It is only because sex is considered taboo that any complete solutions do not emerge
	- Unlike other evil actions, here, everyone wants to do it, but also criticize it
	- But I understand why this is, because sex has several effects on people and society
	- Because of this, those who take the leap to engage in it end up being criticized for it
	- Under this new philosophical framework, sex will not be considered a taboo
	- And at the same time, sexual assault will become an invalid action
	- In this way, sex will also stop being a taboo topic

- The consideration of God ("What Will God Think?")
	- One of the main principles I believe in is that, if I am wrong, and the traditional ideas of God is right, then I must be able to justify my choices before God, and if he disagrees, I must be willing to accept the punishment for it. But if I am wrong, he will be able to prove to me why I am wrong. And as that is my stance, I have grounded my ideas on an inclination towards the absolute truth, and secondarily, harmony. And as of now, he hasn't proven to me why I am wrong. But no human should be able to arbitrarily judge me, because as a person who follows the truth, and has also had a wide variety of experiences, I am usually able to see through the arbitrary cultural influences and thusly formed agendas in many people's opinions. So, I do not feel bad when people of religious traditions criticize my perspectives simply based on their religions, because I have thought this through a lot. However, I do very well welcome criticism that is based on logic, in case you can disprove my views. As for judgement, only God has the authority to judge.
	- HIV
		- This is used as an argument to point out extramarital relationships are immoral
		- I think the presence of HIV has a lot to do with lack of hygiene, and character
		- First of all, one must know the partner very well before sleeping with them
		- Secondly, one should not sleep around, treating human bodies like flesh
		- I believe HIV acts as a deterrent to these issues
		- One must have self discipline, but not to the levels of stressing oneself arbitrarily
		- One must be self-aware, and should use condoms before having casual sex
		- One must be familiar with the conditions of human nature, and get tested for HIV
		- This is not very different from maintaining hygiene and safety from generic health hazards
	- The story of the Tower of Babel
		- I think a problem lay clearly in the level of maturity of the people at the time
		- They thought God was in the sky, and tried to build a large building to overpower him
		- God ended up stopping their stupidity, which would've only been a waste of time
		- Story checks out fine
			- But I think God could've just told them why it's a stupid idea
			- But I guess, the world is not a project with a progress bar after all
		- Also, they built the tower in an act of defiance to Adonai's authority
		- By that reason, the story still checks out fine under the Jewish religious framework

- Resolution of War
	- I've understood that war is necessary
	- But however, as a Trekkie, we must be able to resolve wars too
	- Now, the only way to resolve conflicts confidently is to first remember predestination
	- Nextly, the idea is that if truth is always on our side, we will have the best outcome

- Prevention of War
	- We must first remember the factors through which a peaceful society will turn to war
	- Example 1: Growth of Technology without Studies
		- This includes capitalistic societies, where only some people learn technologies
	- Example 2: Forgetting Values and Forgetting to Question Everything
		- The outlined values 
		- It can be said that some people may question values to suit their needs
		- But truth is resistant to questioning
		- And if there is a true opinion that conflicts with the social values, then
		- The one who stands for it should work to dismantle all the opinions that defend it
		- To do this when things seem doubtful, one must remember predestination
		- You must be able to defend the truths that you stand for
		- And if the ground truth is not in line with what you believe in, you have to adapt
		- And you adapt by controlling your desires, by knowing the nature, vastness and limits of reality

- Randomness
	- The effect of determinism is seen when you perform some actions
	- That is, you may find certain solutions without even putting the slightest effort into it
	- That is, when you are performing an action that requires you to put in conscious effort, but you came to the result without putting in that effort
	- Examples
		- An example is when I was walking through a road, and I knew that I had to take a turn at some point, but I didn't remember where that point was. As I was thinking of something and walking, a motorbike honked and it prompted me to look left, and there was my road.
		- Another example is when you want to skip to a specific page number in a book, and you did not even have an idea about the differences between the actual book page and the content page number, and you make a guess and open it directly to the right page, instead of picking one page and going back or forth until you find it.

- Proper Method of Declaring War
	- Condition 1: Establish Levels of Sentience
	- Condition 2: Assess Threat Level (Do they stay in their lane)

- [[How to Prove or Disprove a Religion]]
	- Ask Questions
		- Would you kill a girl who believes in fairies, because it's non-scientific?
		- (The Muslim answer is,  yes, if they are post-pubescent)

- The Belief that Holy Texts are Precise
	- Mohammedans say that no one could've created a text that does not contradict itself like the Qur'an
	- I believe they simply have not read enough books to begin with, terming everything as Haraam

- Nations
	- Since logic is based on axioms, and axioms are a subset of reality, a community that adheres to a set of axioms become a nation.
- Infections
	- Since a nation is established by axioms, and peace is established by proper understanding of different axioms, it is possible that peace will be destroyed when we lose such an understanding.
	- This is similar to how disease spreads when the immune system weakens.
	- Infections are a part of reality, in biology, computer viruses, and even ideologies.
	- Since ideological viruses spread by
