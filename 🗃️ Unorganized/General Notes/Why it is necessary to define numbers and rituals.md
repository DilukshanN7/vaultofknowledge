## Example of Washing Machine

If you ask someone how many hours or strokes you need to wash a cloth for, they will tell you, "till it's clean, you silly".

But the question has its relevance when you are designing a washing machine.
When you are defining a washing machine, you would want to define the pattern and duration of washing.

One could say that you could test the clothes 

It is one thing to define a washing machine that performs a systematic wash based on these principles.
But another form of washing machine can be devised based, that performs a wash until clothes are observed to be clean.

--But even that works by not knowing

One could say that this is a difficult task.
But that is what makes products exceptional.
