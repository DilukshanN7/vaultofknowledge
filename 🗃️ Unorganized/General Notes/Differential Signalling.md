It is commonly confused with balanced cabling, which is a [[Cabling Schemes|cabling scheme]] usually used with differential signalling.

Basically, any external noise will affect both polarities equally, so taking their difference, the noise can be cancelled out.

A differential receiver performs the subtraction, and hence common-mode noise rejection, regardless of whether the signal is differential or single-ended.

Basically, differential signalling is concerned with the added headroom (due to doubled voltage), while balanced signalling
