Notes:
- Some people hate the idea of hierarchical tags

Some ideas:
- Hierarchical Tags are useful when you want to fit a property into a category in addition to the subcategory.
	- Example: With regards to discussion forums, etc. where you may sometimes want to seek help from just the specific community, and other times from the broader community.
- Hierarchical Tags show tag relationships
	- Example: In StackOverflow, `integrals` is a subset of `calculus`. In other examples, using one tag makes it an umbrella for many other tags, so we can only use an umbrella tag.
- It is better for a file picker to select by tags
	- Example: When looking for a file, use the tags `projects/blender`, `donut`, `white`. This also lets you easily add more descriptions to the files.
	- If you want to select multiple files, you could just group them all under yet another umbrella tag, for example, if you want both donuts and plates to be listed in a single window without listing all projects by using just `projects/blender`, you could use a tag like `kitchen` and supply `projects/blender`, `kitchen` to get all of them.
- You can't expect the users to tag all files individually
	- People are lazy, and put stuff in new folders, or save everything to desktop.
	- We can fix it by listing everything as untagged, and creating `new-tag`s. Just copying what they do with folders.
- Tags can lead to a keyboard-centric approach
	- There can be many tags when there are too many files. So, selecting tags by mouse won't be easier than navigating folders, where only a few folders are displayed at once.
		- Perhaps one can set a parent tags section with only a limited number of tags, and when you select them, you can select their subtags.
		- However, that will mean you have to separate parent tags and adjective tags. At this point, the function of parent tags become similar to that of folders, except that they still can have multiple parent tags.
		- The keyboard workflow will definitely become popular. The
