Notes:
- Some people hate the idea of hierarchical tags

Some ideas:
- Hierarchical Tags are useful when you want to fit a property into a category in addition to the subcategory.
	- Example: With regards to discussion forums, etc. where you may sometimes want to seek help from just the specific community, and other times from the broader community.
- Hierarchical Tags show tag relationships
	- Example: In StackOverflow, `integrals` is a subset of `calculus`. In other examples, using one tag makes it an umbrella for many other tags, so we can only use an umbrella tag.
