So Alhamdulillah, we've moved into a different I'm set up but I pray that Allah SWT makes it more beneficial it's more conducive to a, classroom environment it is better to have people packed in, and you know hopefully Insha Allah Ta'ala, being regular in some of the classes that we have here but obviously this is a very unique lecture that we have here tonight. 

It's it's not one that's in response to any sort of emergency it's actually one that compliments is meant to compliment the collection that we just released which has been in the works for months (Alhamdulilla Rabb Ul Aal Ameen) on the age of Aisha  and the name of the collection was more than just a number and the idea was to make sure that we don't only contextualize the age of Aisha  in broader context using an interdisciplinary approach as did Azudallah along with Dr. Brown or looking at you know what the definition of a child has been and is today and will be in the future but instead to actually reclaim the entire narrative about Aisha .

And I've told this story in the past before about you know an incident that I had with a woman at University of Florida who could not come to terms or grapple with this particular issue of the age of Aisha  but Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala blessed her through knowing the person of Aisha  and had to actually come to Islam through that knowledge of Aisha as a person and actually to name her daughter Aisha once she gave birth to Aisha.

Because one thing if you just pay very close attention to if you attend Jamar Altimas if you attend Islamic lectures the amount of mentions that AIsha  gets is more than any woman in the lifetime of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam and as much as any man in the lifetime of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam in fact the last culture that I gave I ended off 


with a story about Aisha  and because through Aisha we know the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam through Aisha we know our religion through Aisha  we developed not just a greater appreciation of love for the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam but we actually develop a greater love and appreciation for her and she is our mother and so I want you to first and foremost understand that we're talking about your mom my mom she is as beloved to us as our own biological mothers would be and she is our mother because Allah subhana wa ta'ala gave her that distinction when he gave that distinction to the wives of the messenger Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam and she is our mother and that she is the access that had we not had we would not know our religion in the way that we know our religion today can you imagine how much we'd be deprived from were not for Aisha  an huh and the wisdom of Allah Subhanu Wa Ta'ala in placing a woman like each Aisha  in the life of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam and by extension in our lives through her example and through her entrance into the example of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam so where does the debate about the age of Aisha  come into and it's very interesting 

because the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam sometime fourteen hundred and fifty years ago all right so we're talking you know centuries ago and over the years there have been different attacks on the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam and obviously there is an agenda behind the attacks on the Prophet Peace Be Upon Him starting from the time that he lived Himself Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam and as you go through generation after generation you see the evolution of those attacks on the person and the character of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam this particular topic which is a favorite talking point of Islamophobes today was not just a minor point or a footnote in the talking points of Islamophobes over thirteen centuries it was completely non-existence meaning you cannot find in the hundreds and hundreds of books of attacks on the 


Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam character from Quraysh to the Orientalists to the to the early European writers on the character of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam you cannot find a single attack on this particular facet of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam's life not one person takes objection to it in fact it is not even an item for discussion within the Islamic tradition itself there are no lengthy discourses about the age of Aisha  that exists from an imam al-ghazali or Shehel Azam bin Teiyya so both the defense as well as the discourse not necessarily in the context of a defense both of those are contemporary issues that have been brought up so when we say not only was this not an issue in the time of the prophets Alayhi Al-Salaam in the 7th century where Quraysh employed every attack they possibly could on the character and the person of the Prophet Peace Be Upon Him it was not an issue until the 21st century yet somehow it's become the favorite talking point to try to portray the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam in a certain way

and there are numerous ways that we could approach the issue you could approach it and say well look at marriages in the past right and you could say you could point to how unfair the uniqueness of the critique of the prophets lie some is in this regard because if you took from Christian tradition or Jewish tradition or completely secular tradition you will find people that were married with much larger age gaps than that of the prophets like some and Aisha  including for example those that that believe that Mariam Alayhi Al-Salaam that Mary was married to Joseph and the age gap being almost twice as much as the age gap between the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam and Aisha  and huh with Maria Alayhi Al-Salaam that I'm being in her teens and Joseph being in his 80s but that not being a discussion not being an issue to be brought up

and I remember you know it was interesting to me as I was looking when I first started studying the biographies of people and the time of the Prophet Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam as a whole and I'll never forget something that actually happened with me and it wasn't in the context of an attack or a discourse I was just reading in the Tabaqat and the Isaba about Abd Allah Ibn Amir ibn Al Aas, May Allah Be Pleased With Him And His Father and it listed Amir ibn Al Aas and the mother of Abd Allah ibn Amir ibn Al Aas as 12 and 10 when Abd Allah was born and I went hmm that must be a typo then I realized it wasn't because I started cross-checking all the sources like wait they had twelve-year-old parents back to that could you imagine a twelve-year-old walking around with a child right a 12 year old man and a 10 year old woman walking around in the mess and you'd be like wait what is this that's because human beings looked so decidedly different 1,400 years ago than they do today right and some how are you finding Imam Al-Shafi'i Rahim Allah talking about you know a 50 year old grandmother with a 13 year old grandson and you're just like what's going on here how how is this all evolving and cases of law that took place at the time and you
