	- Checks `/proc/dumchar_info` (gives most details)
	- Checks `/proc/mtd` (second best solution, doesn't exist in most new devices)
	- Checks `/proc/emmc` (third best solution, should have about as much as the previous ones)
	- Checks `/dev/block/platform/\*/by-name` (this is cross checked with the next option)
	- Checks `/proc/partitions`, cross checked with `/proc/mounts` (gives us at least the list of mounted partitions)

## Notes
### From "MTK Platform Partition Meaning", from GitHub Gists

I first copy-pasted it verbatim, and made some minor modifications:
- Capitalized partition names
- Corrected grammar in some instances
- Codified small lettered codenames
