They work using a *Lithium Metal Oxide* **cathode**, which is oxidized during charging and that forms the **anode**, which is comprised of *Lithium Ions* held in place by a *Graphite (or Silicon) Lattice* and *Electrons*.

**Exception:** *Lithium Titanate* batteries replace the *Graphite or Silicon* anode with *Titanium Oxide*.

The **electrolyte**

The electrolyte is also protected from degradation by interaction with electrons by the formation of a *Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI)*.
## Cathode
- LiMX (M = Metal, X=Oxidizing agent)

$\text{LiMX} \rightarrow \text{Li}^+ + \text{e}^-$ ($\text{E}^\ominus = \text{3.05 V}$)

## Anode
- $\text{LiC}_6 \: / \: \text{LiTi}_5\text{O}_{12}$

$\text{LiMX} \rightarrow \text{Li}^+ + \text{e}^-$ ($\text{E}^\ominus = \text{3.05 V}$)
