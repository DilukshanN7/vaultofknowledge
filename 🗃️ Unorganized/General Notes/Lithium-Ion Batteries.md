They work using a *Lithium Metal Oxide* **cathode**, which is oxidized during charging and that forms the **anode**, which is comprised of *Lithium Ions* held in place by a *Graphite (or Silicon) Lattice* and *Electrons*.

==**Exception:** *Lithium Titanate* batteries replace the *Graphite or Silicon* anode with *Titanium Oxide*.==

The **electrolyte** is made up of various Lithium salts.

The electrolyte is also protected from degradation by interaction with electrons by the formation of a *Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI)*.

## Cathode
- $\text{LiMO}$ (M = Metal)

**Reaction During Charging:**
$\text{LiMX} \rightarrow \text{MX} + \text{Li}^+ + \text{e}^-$ ($\text{E}^\ominus = \text{-1.0 V}$)
### Examples of Cathodes
| Battery Type | Abbreviation | Cathode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lithium Cobalt Oxide | LCO | $\text{LiCoO}_2$ |
| Lithium Manganese Oxide | LMO | $\text{LiMn}_2\text{O}_4$ |
| Lithium Iron Phosphate | LFP | $\text{LiFePO}_4$ |
| Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt | NMC | $\text{LiNiMnCoO}_4$ |
| Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide | NCA | $\text{LiNiCoAlO}_2$ |
| Lithium Titanate | LTO | $\text{LiMnO}_2$ |
==Battery cell descriptions like NMCXYZ means NMC with proportions of Ni:Mn:Co in the ratio X:Y:Z.==
## Anode
- $\text{LiY}$ (Y=Lattice Material)

**Reaction During Charging:**
$\text{C}_6 + \text{Li}^+ + \text{e}^- \rightarrow \text{LiC}_6$ ($\text{E}^\ominus = \text{3.05 V}$)
### Examples of Anode
- $\text{LiC}_6$
- $\text{LiTi}_5\text{O}_{12}$
