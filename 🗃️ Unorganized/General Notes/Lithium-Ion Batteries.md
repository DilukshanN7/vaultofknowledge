They work using a *Lithium Metal Oxide* **cathode**, which is oxidized during charging and that forms the **anode**, which is comprised of *Lithium Ions* held in place by a *Graphite (or Silicon) Lattice* and *Electrons*.

==**Exception:** *Lithium Titanate* batteries replace the *Graphite or Silicon* anode with *Titanium Oxide*.==

The **electrolyte** is made up of various Lithium salts.

The electrolyte is also protected from degradation by interaction with electrons by the formation of a *Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI)*.

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{cell} = \text{E}^\ominus_\text{cathode} - \text{E}^\ominus_\text{anode}$

However, the potential of the reaction at the anode is sometimes expressed as an _oxidation potential_:

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{oxidation} = -\text{E}^\ominus_\text{reduction}$

The oxidation potential is a measure of the tendency of the reducing agent to be oxidized but does not represent the physical potential at an electrode. With this notation, the cell voltage equation is written with a plus sign.

$\text{E}^\ominus_\text{cell} = \text{E}^\ominus_\text{oxidation} + \text{E}^\ominus_\text{reduction}$
