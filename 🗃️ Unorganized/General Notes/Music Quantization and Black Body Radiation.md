Music is quantized in beats

Fourier Transform can transform any structure (like a song or a continuous painting) into a single equation (set of frequencies at an amplitude / a set of cycles at a radius giving strokes)

The key idea would be to represent silences as low amplitude waves and discontinuities in paintings as thin unnoticeable strokes.

So, does that mean, since a black body absorbs and emits all frequencies, each frequency may have a characteristic 

So that defines the electromagnetic sound of the black body?

Could that also be the colour of the black body?
