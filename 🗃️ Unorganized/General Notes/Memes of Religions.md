# Trying to Define Indian Beliefs in English
## Me Trying to Define Them Purely in English
Hell, I'll tell you this was hard.

I started like:
- X Perspective of the Beliefs of Indians following the Vedas

But it sucked. Then I wrote it down like:
- Vedic Hinduism (Beliefs of Indians following the Vedas)
- X Darshana of Vedic Hinduism (X Perspective of Indians following the Vedas)

Then I tried an alternative:
- Islam (Submission)
- X Aqeedah  (X Perspective on How to Follow Submission)
- (X Perspective of People who Follow Submission)
- (X Perspective on Following Submission)

Then I tried:
- (Beliefs of Xs who Follow Y)
- (A Perspective of Following Y according to Xs)
- (A Perspective of Xs Following Y)

- Finally I realized that I should understand that there is an ontological difference between:
	- "Hinduism" (A Western Grouping that literally means the "Beliefs of Indians EXCLUDING Muslims, Christians, Jews and Parsis") and
	- "Perspectives of Indians" (The True Classification)

To fix this
## How The Westerners Probably Defined
- Westerners: "These are "Indian Beliefs""
- Westerners: "They say they have different perspectives"
- Westerners: "Some have different perspectives based on Vedas" (Six Broad Perspectives)
- Westerners: "Others have free perspectives" (Buddhism, Jainism, etc.)
- Westerners: "These are perspectives of the Indians": *defines them*
- Westerners: "And we'll call the people of the land Hindus"
- Westerners: "But we'll only use the term to describe people of their native beliefs"
- Westerners: "And we'll call the others in the land separately" (Muslims, Christians)
Why? Here's my guess:
- "These Indians aside from Muslims and Christians rely on priests to know their culture"
- "We can't fool the Muslims and Christians, but we can fool the others and take over this place"
- "Let's translate their books and make our compilation more accessible"
- "Let's then make them all believe that this compilation is their divine truth"
- "Let's prioritize the worst texts they have to sow discord in the community" (Manu Smriti, Vaishnava Dharma Shastra)
- "Let's feed on their pride and make the thinking priestly classes feel superior in a divine right"
- "Let's make the working classes who don't think too much feel oppressed by the corrupt priestly class"
- "Let's make the working class people finally fight the priestly class to gain freedom"
- "And then let's take charge of this nation in the name of fixing their divisiveness"
# To Classify
I will define a Hindu as an Indian, based on Geography. (Hindu <= Sindhu River)
Hindus have different perspectives.

Some follow Vedas
Some follow Other Stuff
Some follow Islam
Some follow Christianity
Some follow Judaism
Some are just crazy (Polytheism, Atheism, Strange Rituals)
