# Follow Hadeeths

It was narrated from Ubaidullah bin Abu Rafi from his father, that:
The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: "I do not want to find anyone of you reclining on his pillow, and when bad news comes to him of something that I have commanded or forbidden, he says, 'I do not know, whatever we find in the Book of Allah, we will follow."
