Electromagnets always need a battery to 
A chemical reaction.

i.e. the battery is part of the circuit.

Charged particles alone won't cause magnetic effects, or even move, because it only moves when
it is pushed. I'm talking about the initial motion of the universe.

Of course it will get pushed if they are put in a certain position, by god.
In a special way that the protons and electrons were not close enough to cancel out.
(I'm aware they didn't form until after the quarks)

But what's more likely is that he set in a battery to move the charged particles.
A potential well from the collection of charges, causing a reaction.
And thus flow of particles.

i.e. Big Bang is not a bang, but a Redox Reaction.

But possibly one where god recharges the battery.
So the 

And there's always a circuit

And we have to just choose the circuit.
No, you have no way from choosing the circuit
You are part of the circuit, you can't do it any other way.

The nature of the circuit would be more than like a simple electronic circuit though.
The same circuit is what caused the gluons, quarks, neutrinos and electrons to form
before the protons and the atoms. The same circuit bound the energy into particles
and then made particles flow.

When I was making this, one of my imaginary students asked me a question.


So, if it's just an electron, why is the field still there on one side after
the electron moved to the other side


So I said, that's because it's just a photograph showing how the field will be
when it reaches that point. Or think of it as a current, so 



Wait a minute, is that all that different?


It's really like a stone moving through water.
Or like a fucking comet entering the air.



mc = E/c (c = distance/time, just space and time dimension conversions)

m x/t = ma x / (x/t)
m x/t = m(x/t^2) x / (x/t)
m x/t = m (x^2/t*2) / (x/t)

So if I just replace Maxwell's laws

Will anyone have an objection?

EXPERIMENT

If I rotate this stick, won't I get a radiation outward?
If I rotate this forwards and backwards, won't I get a wave-like radiation outward?

Sense of truth can change.. NO, that's needed in science.

Sense of morality can change.. PROBLEM.
