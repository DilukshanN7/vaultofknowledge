# Belief Diversities

Now Hinduism allows you to believe in anything.

There are 6 Darshans, and some Deity based Sampradayas.

But off-standard Sampradayas are also part of Hinduism.

However, respecting everyone's beliefs is not always the right thing to do.

Some beliefs have bad consequences.

# Examples

## God supremacy

NO! VISHNU IS GREATER.

NO! SHIVA IS GREATER.

NO! MAHAMAYA IS THE CREATOR OF TRINITY.

## God Denial

MAHAMAYA IS MAYA, AN ILLUSION.

## Strange Worship

EVERY GOD HAS A CONSORT, WHO IS MORE WORTHY OF WORSHIP ACCORDING TO HIM.

## Idolatry

Worshipping the statues heavily, hoping god will be pleased by their acts.

## Strange Beliefs

WORSHIPPING GODDESSES WILL GIVE YOU MATERIAL WEALTH IF YOU ASK FOR IT. BUT MATERIAL WEALTH WILL FADE. SHE CAN ALSO GUIDE YOU TO SPIRITUALITY IF YOU ASK FOR IT.
