Our philosophy is that we will have to kill you.
Please let us reside in your lands, we will not kill you now.
We will only kill you when we have enough power to do so.
For now, we are at peace.

We are allowed to break any indefinite term treaty without cause.
But we are also allowed to make treaties if it is convenient for us.
Our mission is to kill all those who do not join us.
But we also like to spread across the world, and avoid being killed.

We are also allowed to lie to those who we have to kill for strategy.


There are some who think that they are among us but are not.
They will say that we do not wish to kill those who do not join us.
But they are disbelievers who follow their humanity instead.
If they are not just lying for war, they too should be killed.

But we are not telling you that we will have to kill you.
Our philosophy contains that we are supposed to kill you.
