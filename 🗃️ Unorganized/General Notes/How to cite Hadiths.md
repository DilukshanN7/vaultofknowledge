When Israel left Gaza, Hamas still started firing rockets in 2006. Perhaps, removal of Islam will be the only thing that leads to peace, because Hamas themselves have cited the Hadeeth collected by the two most reputed Imams:

1. _Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ismail bin Ibrahim Al-Jaafi_ **_Al-Bukhari_**
2. _Abu Al-Hussein Asakir Al-Din_ **_Muslim_** _bin Al-Hajjaj bin Muslim bin Ward Al-Qushayri Al-Naysaburi_

in which **_Abu Hurairah_** _Abd al-Rahman bin Sakhr al-Dawsi al-Zahrani_, a companion of Mohammed narrates:

> Allah's Messenger ﷺ said: “The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.”

The chain of narration (isnad) was:

_Abu Hafs_ **_Qutaybah bin Abi Salih_** _Muslim bin Amr Al-Bahili_ said that:

_➡_ **_Y'aqub bin 'Abdur Rahman_** _bin Muhammad bin 'Abdullah bin 'Abd Qari_ said on the authority of his father

➡ **_'Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad_** _bin 'Abdullah bin 'Abd Qari_ who said on the authority of

➡ **_Suhail_** _ibn ‘Amr ibn Abd Shams_ who said on the authority of

➡ **_Abu Hurairah_** _Abd al-Rahman bin Sakhr al-Dawsi al-Zahrani_

➡ **_Allah's Messenger_** _Mohammed ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib_ **_ﷺ_**

Muslim sources in Arabic cite these people as trusted, and that is the criteria by which the two Imams collected it in their Sahihayn - Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.
