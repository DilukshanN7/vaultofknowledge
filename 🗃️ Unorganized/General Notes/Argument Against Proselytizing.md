A religion is akin to a lock. It secures your understanding of the world.

Now, taking a religion from someone else blindly is like taking their lock.
And in doing so, you leave your safety at their discretion, because they may have a loophole in it.

Now, criticizing a lock is a good thing. A lock may have loopholes in it.
But the point is, in the end, you have to choose the lock which you think is the most secure.
Not a lock that someone tells you is more secure.

After all, religion is for your security.

My argument against priests is the same thing, in addition to the knowledge that centralized power is a point of failure.
Also, this is not an argument against missionary religions, it's just against the forced proselytization of religions.
