The qualify, I do not imply the Arabic word that means the "recitation", but rather the text that's attributed to Mohammed and used by his followers worldwide as the "word of Allah".

Also, the Arabic word "Allah", or "al-ilah" means "the one to be worshipped", and I do not believe a desire for worship is an aspect of god, just as I do would not desire for anything to worship me, even if I created them, like in a story or as a robot.

And I do not like to capitalize the letter "G" in "god" because I do not consider god to be a proper noun. I may have used the notation in the past, and may intentionally or accidentally use it in the future when trying to converse with some people, just to ensure that we are talking about the same .
