Religion is only formed by back attribution.

For example, Hindus believe that the world is the Leela of Krishna.
I will qualify that.

According to Hindu Metaphysics, Brahman is the ultimate reality.
Brahman creates the world, which is described differently in different Darshanas.
The physical reality is formed by the aspect of Maya, which veils absolute reality from physical reality.

It is questioned whether Maya is under the control of Brahman or not in different Darshanas.
It is questioned whether Maya is the veil that veils the Dualistic or Non-Dualistic nature of Brahman.
