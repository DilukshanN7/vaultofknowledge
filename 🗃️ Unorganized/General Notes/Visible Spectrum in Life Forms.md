The human eye's [[tristimulus]] response curve has a similar range, with frequencies corresponding to blue and yellow light having low responses, while green has a peak. Now, colours in human eyes are not fundamental, but rather due to the stimulation of red, green and blue cells of the same frequency, which is what tri-stimulus is. But, we can represent that frequency as the combination of RGB values using the [[RGB Colour Model]], which replicates exactly what our eyes do!

So the thing is, our eyes have "vitreous humor", which is a fluid that keeps the retina in shape. So this flow of light through the fluid filters it in a similar fashion to how water doe
