- The Parable of Analogy
	- If you stick with one model, a set of rules can break it
	- If you change the analogy, you have to change the whole set of rules that apply to it
	- For example:
		- If one claims that word of god exists, I can bring the finite letters argument
		- But if they then bring the analogy of a CPU, then the hardware-software argument applies
	- Simpler example
