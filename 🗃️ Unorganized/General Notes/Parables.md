- The Parable of Analogy
	- If you stick with one model, a set of rules can break it
	- If you change the analogy, you have to change the whole set of rules that apply to it
	- For example:
		- If one claims that word of god exists, I can bring the finite letters argument
		- But if they then bring the analogy of a CPU, then the hardware-software argument applies
	- Simpler example

- Dictionary Attack
	- Do not call captive women slaves, or yourselves slave owners
	- But instead, call them "my girl"
	- But also, know that you have rights over them, and they are not equal to free people
	- Essentially this is slavery, but it denies any claims that this was slavery
	- Because this is not uncontrolled slavery, but controlled slavery

**My Philosophy** #rough #post
My philosophy is founded on two basic principles, that is:
1. Punishment is not a deterrent for crime
2. We are only guided by our desires

I understand it in terms of sensual desires.

A sexual relationship is defined as a relationship in which one has sex.
However, I do not see why the action of sex defines the relationship more than intimacy.
To me, sex is simply one of the ways in which intimacy can be achieved.

The main reason is religion, however, I do not recognize the societal models of religions as valid.

Those who deny these two basic truths will lose, in the most miserable manner.
Miserable, because people deny these truths to claim the moral high ground, despite feeling the same way themselves.
They deceive people who lack self discipline and struggle to control their feelings by telling them easy to believe lies.
In doing so to achieve personal satisfaction, they perpetuate a culture where people of their own kin are harmed.

And the real evil that exists as lust is "achieving personal satisfaction at the expense of others."
Who is guilty of this? People who have consensual intimate relationships, or people who kill such people, acting as
