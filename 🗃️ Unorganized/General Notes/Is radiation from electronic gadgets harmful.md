No it isn't you silly.
# Frequency
2.4 GHz is way below 400 THz, where IR transcends to visible spectrum. It is non-ionizing, unlike X-rays and Gamma Rays.
# Intensity
Routers emit radiation at 0.1W.
Microwave emits 2.4 GHz at 1000W.

This is 10000 times more than a router.

The Sun emits radiation of all frequencies, and about 100 THz - 1 PHz reaches the ground, at around 10W. This ends up being hotter than a microwave.
