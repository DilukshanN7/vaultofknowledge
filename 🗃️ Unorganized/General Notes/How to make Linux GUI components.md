e.g.
- Dock
- Settings Sidebar (Should be similar to settings app + mouse event handling)

- Window Manager will handle Window theming and title bars
- Custom window design can be used for other windows (e.g. bars, etc.)


Everyone wants the same thing, not to get hurt, have desires, like owning Porsches, etc.
"But only some people can have Porsches, resources aren't infinite."
If only some people can have Porsches and others should be slaves, fine. I just want a number for how many. And don't fucking deviate from it.
"But religion already does that bro." - wait, I'll come to it.
(by this I don't mean religion sets the number of people, but the permitted actions.)
(now religions like Islam come and say that all desires are evil. That's logical, but desires are what make you human. You can't just say desires )
When you scientifically define such a number, you'll see the absurdity of such a number.
Only when you non-scientifically, arbitrarily define such a number can you get such a number.

Because in science, you find that with enough resources, everyone can get Porsches, and you also find what needs to be done so that everyone has enough resources. Only deviation from science will get you to absurd inequal conclusions.
