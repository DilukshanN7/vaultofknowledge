- Ionizing Radiation: UV-C, X-Rays, Gamma Rays
- Zero Pressure: Missing the 300 kg/sq.inch of nominal pressure on our body, causing it to inflate and explode
- No Atmosphere: No air for survival
- No Water: No water for survival or hygiene
- No Food: No food for survival
- No Biodiversity: Depressing unnatural environment
- No Gravity: No gravity for normal activities like bathing
- IF other sentient life forms are found: Politics and warfare all over again

But it is still good as an adventure.

Think of the ideas:
- Wormhole transport
- Teleporting
- Spacetime Warping
- Warp Drives
- Space Resources
- Rapid Advancement of Stellar Development by resource sharing

Spacetime warping etc. are so high level to learn, so it makes you wonder, if later on we will be interested in creating a new universe from scratch, perhaps in a free space in another dimension?

The idea is that creating a universe in this universe won't be right, and the fact that the universe had an evolutionary path (as signified by our lack of infinite maturity here on Earth) would
