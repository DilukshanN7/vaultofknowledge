- They think the western way of life is immoral
	- When criticizing "slave" ownership, they say western partners have no ownership rights
	- They say that these women are not chaste (as if that's a universal problem)
	- That is, what they were doing is Zina
	- They say that such women may have also wanted to initiate sex with their captors
	- That is, it may not have always been that only the captors initiated sex with their slaves
	- They say that slavery was to fix these immoralities, instead of lashing them for Zina
	- We don't know if slave women needed to work for their freedom
	- It mostly depended on the piety of the Muslims
	- So that's why Islam focused on improving the piety of Muslims

Here, Muslims claim that Islam didn't increase slavery, but rather, it only took slaves so that they'll be turned into Muslims and then freed when the masters become pious.

(Mathematically and economically, this doesn't add up; but intentionally, possible, in the most stupid way imaginable)
