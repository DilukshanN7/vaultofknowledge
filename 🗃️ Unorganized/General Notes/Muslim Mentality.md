- They think the western way of life is immoral AND justify slavery as a way to fix it
	- **When criticizing "slave" ownership, they say western partners have no ownership rights**
	- They say that these women are not chaste (as if that's a universal problem)
	- **That is, what they were doing is Zina**
	- They say that such women may have also wanted to initiate sex with their captors
	- **That is, it may not have always been that only the captors initiated sex with their slaves**
	- They say that slavery was to fix these immoralities, instead of lashing them for Zina
	- **That is, slavery worked as a method for implementing gradual change more peacefully**
	- We don't know if slave women needed to work for their freedom
	- It mostly depended on the piety of the Muslims
	- So that's why Islam focused on improving the piety of Muslims
	- **That is, when Muslims make mistakes, they can release them to be free of sin**
	- And secondly, as an act of grace (it's also possible to release them for ransom)

Here, Muslims claim that Islam didn't increase slavery, but rather, it only took slaves so that they'll be turned into Muslims and then freed when the masters become pious. (Mathematically and economically, this doesn't add up; but intentionally, possible, in the most stupid way imaginable)

More sensibly, it only conveys that those who believe this are people with no self control, and can't prevent having sex to the point that they have to steal women for sex, so much so that Islam had to be created where women go from being sex slaves to "concubines who are lawful for having sex with" provided consent is provided (with ambiguity on whether consent is obtained meaningfully - with one major example being that silence means "yes").
