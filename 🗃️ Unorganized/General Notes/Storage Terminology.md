Abstract Concepts

- Shaft (HDD Anatomy)
- Platter (HDD Anatomy)
## Cylinder-Head-Sector (CHS) Addressing
- Head (Read/Write Arms) (HDD Anatomy)
- Cluster (Windows) / Block (Linux) / Allocation Unit (Neutral)
- Track (Radial Divisions) (Also called a segment, but bad terminology)
- Sector (Circumferential Divisions)
	- Disc Sector (The whole sector)
	- Track Sector (The sector of a track) (Allocation Units / Blocks / Clusters)
- Sectors per Track (differs per track, the middle tracks have fewer sectors to store the same data)
- Cylinder (Same track in all platters)
## Logical Block Addressing
- Logical Block Address (LBA)
- Logical Sector sizes can vary due to skew/interleave
