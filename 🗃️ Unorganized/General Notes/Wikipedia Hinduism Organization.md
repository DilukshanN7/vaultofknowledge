# Advaita Vedanta

It is based on the teachings of Adi Shankara, who is the first Shankaracharya.

His followers are Shankaracharyas. (Acharya means teacher, so Shankaracharya means teacher in the ways of Shankara)

He set up four monasteries (called mathas or pithams) where realised men would teach.
