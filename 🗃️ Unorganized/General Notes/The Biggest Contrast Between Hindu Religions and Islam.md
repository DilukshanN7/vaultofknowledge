The biggest difference between Hindu Religions and Abrahamic Religions is that in Hindu religions, God judges a person according to their beliefs, and it rejects the idea that God will send forth human prophets to convey his message. It does say that God can take human incarnations on earth, however, he will only do so when it is necessary, and he will not leave a binding law.
