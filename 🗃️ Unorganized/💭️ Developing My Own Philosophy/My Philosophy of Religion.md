We are like the leaves of a plant.
When we harm another leaf, it is the plant that we are harming.
And that plant is what I call god.

Who created the leaf?
Well, I said the plant is reality.
I could use the model of the dancer in an outfit.
The dancer doing his dance, dressed in an outfit is the creation.
And he himself is the creation.
And we are all parts of his body, moving with the rhythm.
