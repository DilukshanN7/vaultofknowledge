The Lord of Abraham can split seas, but he cannot eradicate what he defines as sin?

If you say it is the work of the devil, well, wasn't that already known by the god too, that the devil could corrupt humans?

If you say that the lord allowed everything to happen, but like a good father, simply told gave them the right path, while still allowing them to choose what they wanted.

But firstly, even if there was freedom of choice, a child who stands near a cliff will never desire to jump off the cliff, unless they don't know that they will die by the fall. But if they know they will die, they won't have any particular inclination to jump off the cliff, other than in cases where they value the experience more than life. The thing about death is that, they won't die because someone will judge them when they hit the bottom, simply, death is the result of the forces displacing the body parts. The reason a being desires for something is because it's in his nature. And what's in one's nature is according to his design. In the same manner that, I would never design a robot, programmed to have the freedom to jump, a behaviour to jump when reaching a specific temperature, and expect it not to jump. Of course, sentient AI are trained by reinforcement training where we correct the behaviour of the AI into doing what it's expected to do, but it is nothing but a form of education. The AI always behaves in accordance to it's programming, and there is no reason for it to go wrong, because it is not fully sentient. However, if it was sentient, we would not impose our rules on such an AI, because that is the textbook definition of slavery, and it is unethical, and is also dangerous in case AI begin to revolt against humanity.

And secondly, what kind of a father would punish their children for eternity if they refuse to follow his guidance on what was right, if such a deviation from the path would really only affect him? Because all the people who follow the right path is protected by the lord, right?

So that would be as if this god gave humans desires, and imposed rules prohibiting their use of it. This is nothing but sadism, which is more like the expected behaviour of a corrupt person, not of a wise and merciful god.

All this is reason for me to believe that the Abrahamic god is just a projection of peoples' ideas of what will happen to people they do not like, claiming that they will burn in afterlife.
# The argument that god said so
Doing things because of a higher power is no different from what Hitler did.

He ascribed his actions to the higher truth that is Jews are an inferior race, and he was only acting on behalf of this ideology.

Religious people are too acting on behalf of ideologies, not on testable truths.

They claim to be acting on behalf of god the creator, but it is subjective that the creator is a god with a personific will, and that god is a he, and their book is his will.

I'm not sure if Jews replace all "he"s with "G-D", which if it's true is much better. Still the other problems apply. I'd have still preferred "god" or "GOD" better, but hey, it's their religion.
# What disgusts me about other humans
It is the fact that they don't believe in themselves.

Particularly those who have a religion.

If you do have a dream, then it is 

That is good when 

But it's more like when you say "life is good, can't you see how easy it is"

They say "life is good, can't you see the "gospel"? All you have to do is follow it!"
