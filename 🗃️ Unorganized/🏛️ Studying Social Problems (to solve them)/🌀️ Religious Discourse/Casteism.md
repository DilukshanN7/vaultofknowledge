Casteism is often viewed as something similar to racism, but there is a certain difference to it.

Casteism has its roots in religious segregation of labour required to sustain a civilization. This was how the Indo-Aryans created the scriptures of the Hindu religion. According to them, anyone could choose their caste by following the right rituals.

The types of castes included:

- The priestly caste
- The fishermen caste
- The farmers caste
- The toilet cleaning and burial caste

But as time went on, people decided that castes were fixed by birth, and there was no escape from it. And also, some of the castes, such as fishermen, farmers who work in muddy fields, and toilet cleaning and burial groups were seen as people of lesser worth than the priestly castes.

This is terrible because without the hard labour that these people performed for us, the society would not have sustained at all. It is not unlike thinking of your mother as having lower worth because she is the one who cleans the filthy plates for you.
