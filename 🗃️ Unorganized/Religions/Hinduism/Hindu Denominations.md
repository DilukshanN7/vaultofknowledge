Denominations are also called Sampradayas. (I guess Darshanas should be moved to a separate note.)
# Based on Schools of thought
Schools of thought are also called Darshanas.

## Orthodox Schools

There are six schools of thought, called the Sadh-Darshanas (Six Schools). They are themselves grouped into three groups of two similar schools, as follows:

1. Sankhya and Yoga
2. Nyaya and Vaisheshika
3. Mimamsa and Vedanta

### Detailed Description

- 1. Sankhya (Digital)
	- **Brief**
		- It is a discrete school of thought that explains reality as evolving due to **Prakriti** (Nature of Being)
		- It views **Purusha** (Witness Consciousness) as the centres of consciousness, and the universe as consisting of both **Purusha** and **Prakriti**
		- Hence it is kind of dualistic (separation of mind and matter), discrete and atheistic
	- **Differences with Dualism**
		- Western [[Dualism]] focuses on the difference between "mind" and "body"
		- Sankhya Darshana focuses on the difference between "witness consciousness" and "physical world" - that includes outside nature and one's feelings and sensations
		- The main difference being, "mind" in Dualism considers the mind of an individual person, but "witness consciousness" in Sankhya considers only one observer to the entire world, and "body" in Dualism refers to to a person's body, while the "physical world" encompasses one's body, sensations and the surroundings.
			- This is closer to the idea of "Brain in a Vat", except without a physical Brain or Vat.
			- I guess I'll fix this idea by adding nuances between monism and dualism in their relevant pages
	- **Metaphysics**
		- **Purusa** is part of **Prakriti**
		- Purusa is bound to Prakriti by **Jiva**
		- **Moksha** is how the soul is liberated
	- **Epistemology**
		- Knowledge is possible through three **Pramanas** (Means):
			- **Pratyaksha** (Direct Perception)
			- **Anumaana** (Logical Inference)
			- **Shabda** (Verbal Testimony)
	- **General Description**
		- Evolution of Nature
			- Nature evolves for the sake of the Soul in bondage (due to ignorance).
			- A free Soul simply witnesses the evolution, but he misidentifies himself as being a part of it.
			- When the Soul realizes that it is distinct from Nature and that it cannot evolve, Nature also stops evolving for that Soul.
			- Liberation is the natural goal of every Soul.
		- Cause and Effect
			- The Sankhya Darshana is based on Sat-Karya Vaada (Proposition that Effects are Existent)
				- The effect is pre-existent in the cause, so nothing new is ever created
				- The effect seems distinct from the cause due to an illusion, or Maya
				- Maya has two powers (added from some source)
					- Avarna (Veiling)
					- Vikshepa (Projection)
				- The effect is not a material change in Prakriti, but is a transformation of it (think matrix transformations)
			- Sankhya Darshana explains Sat-Karya Vaada based on Prakriti-Parinama Vaada (Proposition of Transformation of Nature)
		- Cosmic Evolution
			- According to Sankhya, Nature is the source of the world becoming
			- Nature is pure potentiality that evolves into 24 **Tattvas** (Fundamental Elements)
			- The evolution happens due to tensions of the three **Gunas** (Traits) of Nature
				- **Sattva** - Balance and Equilibrium (e.g. Poise, Fineness, Lightness, Illumination, Joy)
				- **Rajas** - Expansion or Activity (e.g. Dynamism, Activity, Excitation, Pain)
				- **Tamas** - Inertia or Resistance to Action (e.g. Coarseness, Heaviness, Obstruction, Sloth)
			- The 24 Tattvas that the world evolves into are:
				- **Prakriti**: The absolute potentiality.
				- **Mahat**: The first product of cosmic evolution. This gives rise to Buddhi (intellect) in living beings.
				- **Ahamkara** (Ego Sense): The second product of evolution. This is responsible for self-sense in living beings.
				- **Manas** (Instinctive Mind): It evolves from the Sattva aspect of Ahamkara.
				- (Doubt)
					- **Antahkarana** (Inner Instruments)
						- **Buddhi** (Intellect)
						- **Manas** (Instinctive Mind)
						- **Aham Kaara** (Ego / I-Sense)
						- **Chittam** (Memory)
				- **Pancha Jnana Indriya** (Five Sense Organs):
					- They evolve from the Sattva aspect of Ahamkara.
					- They are the Ears, Skin, Eyes, Tongue and Nose.
				- **Pancha Karma Indriya** (Five Organs of Action):
					- They too evolve from the Sattva aspect of Ahamkara.
					- They are the Hands, Legs, Vocal Apparatus, Urino-Genital Organ and Anus.
				- **Pancha Tan Matras** (Five Subtle Elements):
					- They evolve from the Tamas aspect of Ahamkara.
					- They are the root energies of Sound (**Shabda**), Touch (**Sparsha**), Form (**Rupa**), Taste (**Rasa**) and Smell (**Gandha**).
				- **Pancha Maha Bhuta** (Five Great Substances):
					- They too evolve from the Tamas aspect of Ahamkara.
					- Earth (**Prithvi**), Air (**Vaayu**), Fire (**Agni**), Water (**Jala**) and Ether (**Aakasha**).
					- This is the visible aspect of the Physical Universe.
	- **Glossary of Terms**
		- Samsara (Cyclic Existence)
		- Kalachakra (The Cycle of Samsara)
		- Avidya (Ignorance)
		- Moksha (Liberation)
		- Manas (Mind)
		- Buddhi (Intellect)
		- Ahamkara (Ego)

	- **Arguments against God by Sankhya philosophers**
		- If the existence of Karma is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without Karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of Karma, then Karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
		- Even if Karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Sankhya Darshana, is an attribute of Prakriti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the Vedas, according to Sankhya Darshana, also confirms this notion.
		- Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya's notion of higher self.
		- Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of Prakriti as the origin of the world, not God.
	- Therefore, Sankhya maintained that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God.

- 2. Yoga (Connection with Reality)
	- It is based on the Sankhya school of thought

				- Nimbarka follows Parinama Vaada (The Proposition of Transformation), which states that the world is a real Parinama (transformation) of Brahman, to explain the cause of the world. Chit (Sentient) and Achit (Non-Sentient) forms of reality exist at a subtle form with Brahman in his natural state, in the varying Shaktis (Capacities). But he exerts his Capacities to bring them to the gross form.
	- 6.3. Vishishta Advaita Vedanta (Special Non-Difference)
		- A Vaishnava school by Ramanujacharya, Ishvara is considered as Vishnu
		- The Tattva is knowledge of three things; Jiva (living beings) / sentient beings (Chit Brahman), Ajiva (non-living beings) / insentient beings (Achit Brahman) and Ishvara (Para Brahman)

				- By Swami Narayana
				- A version of Vishishta Advaita Vedanta, where Para Brahman is Krishna
				- Para Brahman is thought to have manifested as Swaminarayana
				- A distinction is made between Para Brahman, which is Purushottam Narayan (Supreme God), which is thought to reside in Swaminarayana, and Akshar Brahman, which is the cause of cosmic order
				- The original Swaminarayana Sampradaya believed that Akshar is the abode of Purushottam
				- BAPS believe that Akshar Brahman is always present in Earth as a guru, and an ideal devotee, in whom Purushottam Brahman resides

# Based on Deities
Hinduism is subdivided into a number of major Sampradayas. Of the historical division into six Darshanas (Philosophies), two schools, Vedanta and Yoga, are currently the most prominent.

Classified by primary deity or deities, four major types of Hinduism include **Vishnu Worshippers**, **Shiva Worshippers**, **Adiparashakti Worshippers** and **Smartas** (five deities treated as same).

These deity-centered denominations feature a synthesis of various philosophies such as Sankhya, Yoga and Vedanta, as well as shared spiritual concepts such as **Moksha**, **Dharma**, **Karma**, **Samsara**, ethical precepts such as **Ahimsa**, common texts (**Upanishads**, **Puranas**, **Mahabharata**, **Agamas**), ritual grammar and rites of passage (**Vyakarana** and **Kalpa** Vedangas).

## General Overview
- Bhakti Traditions
	- Paramashiva Worship
	- Vishnu Worship
	- Adiparashakti Worship
	- Ganapati Worship
	- Kartikeya Worship
- Advaita Vedanta (No Worship)
- Smarta Tradition (Advaita Vedanta + Bhakti tradition)
	- Worship of 5 dieties in a quincuix pattern, with Ganesha, Shiva, Vishnu, Devi/Durga, Surya and optionally one Ishta Devata in the middle

## Connection Between Darshanas and Denominations
- Shaivite
	- Shaiva Advaita / Shaiva Vishishta Advaita (Saguna Brahman = Shiva)
	- 
# Other Classic Sects
- Shrautism
	- Shrauta communities are very rare in India, the most well known being the ultra-orthodox Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala. They follow the "Purva-Mimamsa" (earlier portion of Vedas) in contrast to Vedanta followed by other Brahmins. They place importance on the performance of Vedic Sacrifice (Yajna). The Nambudiri Brahmins are famous for their preservation of the ancient Somayaagam, Agnichayana rituals which have vanished in other parts of India.

# Notes
Sampradaya in Indian origin religions, namely Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, can be translated as 'tradition', 'spiritual lineage', 'sect', or 'religious system'.

To ensure continuity and transmission of Dharma, various Sampradayas have the Guru-Shishya Parampara in which Parampara or lineage of successive Gurus (masters) and Shishyas (disciples) serves as a spiritual channel and provides a reliable network of relationships that lends stability to a religious identity. 

Shramana is Vedic term for seeker or Shishya. Identification with and followership of Sampradayas is not static, as Sampradayas allow flexibility where one can leave one Sampradaya and enter another or practice religious syncretism by simultaneously following more than one Sampradaya. (This is in contrast to Shakhas)

Samparda is a Punjabi language term, used in Sikhism, for Sampradayas.

## Guru-Shishya Parampara
Sampradayas are living traditions of both teaching and practice within a specific religious-spiritual tradition. They are generally composed of a monastic order within a specific Guru lineage, with ideas developed and transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers. A particular Guru lineage is called Parampara. By receiving Diksha (initiation) into the Parampara of a living Guru, one belongs to its proper Sampradaya.

To ensure continuity through Dharma transmission, various Sampardayas ensure continuity through Guru-Shishya Parampara where Guru teaches Shishyas in Gurukula, Matha, Akhara, and Viharas. Buddhism also has lineage of Gurus. Tibetan Buddhism has lineage of Lamas who teach in Gompas and Stupas.

### Continuity of sampradaya
See also: Guru Gotra and Gurunath

Sampradaya is a body of practice, views and attitudes, which are transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers. Participation in Sampradaya forces continuity with the past, or tradition, but at the same time provides a platform for change from within the community of practitioners of this particular traditional group.
### Diksha: Initiation into Sampradaya
A particular Guru lineage in Guru-Shishya tradition is called Parampara, and may have its own Akharas and Gurukulas. By receiving Diksha (initiation) into the Parampara of a living Guru, one belongs to its proper Sampradaya.

One cannot become a member by birth, as is the case with Gotra, a seminal, or hereditary, dynasty.
### Authority on knowledge of truth

Membership in a Sampradaya not only lends a level of authority to one's claims on truth in Hindu traditional context, but also allows one to make those claims in the first place. An often quoted verse from the Padma Purana states:

> Mantras which are not received in Sampradaya are considered fruitless.

And another verse states:

> Unless one is initiated by a bona-fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession, the mantra he might have received is without any effect.

As Wright and Wright put it,

> If one cannot prove natal legitimacy, one may be cast out as a bastard. The same social standard applies to religious organizations. If a religious group cannot prove its descent from one of the recognized traditions, it risks being dismissed as illegitimate.

Nevertheless, there are also examples of teachers who were not initiated into a Sampradaya, Ramana Maharshi being a well-known example.

A Sanyasi belonging to the Sringeri Sharada Peetham once tried to persuade Ramana to be initiated into Sanyasa, but Ramana refused.
