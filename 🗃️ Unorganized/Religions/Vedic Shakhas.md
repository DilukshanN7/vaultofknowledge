A Vedic **shakha** (Sanskrit śākhā, "branch" or "limb") is a Hindu theological school that specializes in learning certain Vedic texts, or else the traditional texts followed by such a school. An individual follower of a particular school or recension is called a **śākhin**. The term is also used in Hindu philosophy to refer to an adherent of a particular orthodox system.

A related term **caraṇa**, ("conduct of life" or "behavior") is also used to refer to such a Vedic school: "although the words caraṇa and śākhā are sometimes used synonymously, yet caraṇa properly applies to the sect or collection of persons united in one school, and śākhā to the traditional text followed, as in the phrase **śākhām adhite** ("he recites a particular version of the Veda").

The schools have different points of view, described as **śākhābhedaḥ** ("difference of (Vedic) school"). Each school would learn a specific Vedic **Saṃhita** (one of the "four Vedas" properly so-called), as well as its associated **Brahmana**, **Aranyakas**, **Shrauta Sutras**, **Griha Sutras** and **Upanishads**.

In traditional Hindu society affiliation with a specific school is an important aspect of class identity. By the end of the Rig Vedic period the term **Brāhmaṇa (Brahmin)** had come to be applied to all members of the priestly class, but there were subdivisions within this order based both on **varna** (class) and on the **shakha** (branch) with which they were affiliated.

A **Brāhmaṇa (Brahmin)** who changed school would be called **śākhāraṇḍaḥ** ("a traitor to his śākhā").
