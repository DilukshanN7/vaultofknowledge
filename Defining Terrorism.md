Since terrorism is a loaded word, I decided to classify it.

I would say, since terrorism is broadly defined as the use of violence to achieve an ideological goal, it is intended to establish a sense of order to the world. And since bringing order to the natural world is brought about by setting rules, such rules define a method or discipline. Since the concept of discipline is closely tied to the modern system of education, where we learn to observe the world through various segregated disciplines or branches of knowledge, I would say discipline begins with schooling. And hence, terrorism begins at schools.

That is not to say all schools fall under the same category. A scho

A simple example which makes a difference is saying "this is a phone" instead of "we refer to this by the name phone".
