Logic and Creativity are often opposing characteristics. Logic, while useful for understanding things, is a destructive mechanism - because it is literally breaking down things. Creativity is the opposite, it is about making entirely new things, which can be broken down by logic. Creativity is essential for life, but it cannot go on forever without logic, and hence creativity and logic has to go hand in hand. 

I tried to study how creativity can come from a purely mathematical algorithm, i.e. without any random functions since true randomness cannot be generated mathematically. Here's how my idea goes:

**Algorithm:** Action-Sensor-Storage-Read-Apply Function-Store Back-Read both-Binary operation-Store back-Explode!
**Definition:**
1. Action: There should be an action
2. Sensor: There should be an observation of the action
3. Storage: The observation must be stored somewhere for future use
4. Read: The stored observation must be read into a variable for usage
5. Apply Function: The value of the variable has to be modified to generate a new variable
6. Move to Storage: The modified value should be added to the storage for future use
7. Read both: Both values are read into variables for a binary operation
8. Binary Operation: A unique value is formed out of the two values
9. Store the result: The new value is added to the storage for future use
10. Repeat binary operation:  This will keep on creating unique values which arise from existing values.
NOTE: The values will get more and more creative over time. But limits must be imposed to make balance the results. There should also be an algorithm for defining which variables are chosen at an instance.
