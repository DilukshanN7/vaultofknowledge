A waveguide is used to direct a wave along a specific path.
# Types
- Acoustic Waveguides
	- Tin Can Telephone
- RF Waveguides
- Optical Waveguides
	- Optical Fibre
- Transmission Lines
	- Long lines need to take wave nature into account
	- In the past, the [[Submarine Telecommunication Cables|submarine telegraph cables]] faced interference, for which the [[Telegrapher's equations|theory of tranmission lines]] had to be devised.
	- In the present, submarine telecommunication cables are made of optical fibers, so the data is completely free of any interference.
