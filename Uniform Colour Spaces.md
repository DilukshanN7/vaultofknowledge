A uniform colour space (UCS) is a [[colour models|colour model]] that seeks to make the colour-making attributes perceptually uniform, that is identical spatial distance between two colours in a color space equals identical amount of percieved [[colour difference]].

For the distance measure to be perceptually uniform, the set of points whose distance to

A [[Colour Appearance Models|CAM]] under a fixed viewing condition results in a UCS; a UCS with a modelling of variable viewing conditions results in a CAM.

A UCS without such modelling can also be a rudimentary CAM.
