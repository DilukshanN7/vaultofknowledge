# OS Specific Adjustments
## Manjaro GNOME Edition
Manjaro GNOME edition allows changing GNOME layout. This screenshot was prior to GNOME 40, but I think they should still have it.

## Zorin OS
Zorin OS is an aesthetically themed OS based on Ubuntu GNOME. It also supports multiple layouts

## Ubuntu
Ubuntu adds a number of extensions on to stock GNOME to brand it.
I have listed a few differences between Fedora's stock GNOME and Ubuntu here: [[Converting Distro Looks#Fedora to Ubuntu|Converting Fedora to Ubuntu]]

## Pop OS
Pop OS is migrating from GNOME to their own COSMIC desktop environment. A major distinciton from Ubuntu's appearance is the use of a tiling window extension named Pop Shell.

I listed some of the differences here: [[Converting Distro Looks#Differences between Pop OS and Ubuntu|Converting Ubuntu to Pop OS]]
