# OS Specific Adjustments
## Manjaro GNOME Edition
Manjaro GNOME edition allows changing GNOME layout. This screenshot was prior to GNOME 40, but I think they should still have it.

## Zorin OS
Zorin OS is an aesthetically themed OS based on Ubuntu GNOME. It also supports multiple layouts

## Ubuntu MATE
Ubuntu MATE also allows changing layouts

## Ubuntu
Ubuntu adds a number of extensions on to stock GNOME to brand it.
I have listed a few differences between Fedora's stock GNOME and Ubuntu here: [](Converting%20Distro%20Looks.md#Fedora%20to%20Ubuntu%7CConverting%20Fedora%20to%20Ubuntu)

## Pop OS
Pop OS is migrating from GNOME to their own COSMIC desktop environment. A major distinciton from Ubuntu's appearance is the use of a tiling window extension named Pop Shell.

I listed some of the differences here: [](Converting%20Distro%20Looks.md#Differences%20between%20Pop%20OS%20and%20Ubuntu%7CConverting%20Ubuntu%20to%20Pop%20OS)
