The word technology literally means the study of techniques. In a deeper sense, it is the study of the principles of art and craft.

The word originates from a Greek word, τεχνολογία (tekhnología) which means the "systematic treatment of grammar".

It further derives from the word τεχνολόγος (tekhnológos) which means "treating by the rules of art".

It is a combination of the words τέχνη (tékhnē) + -λόγος (-lógos) which means art and -logist restepectively.

λόγος (-lógos) further derives from the word λέγω (légō) which means "to put in order".
