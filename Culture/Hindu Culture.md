Hindus subscribe to a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but have no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.

## Caste Divisions / Chatur Varnas
- Brahmins
- Kshathriyas
- Vaishyas
- Shudras
- Untouchables (Casteless)

The religious theory states that according to the Rig Veda (ancient Hindu book) the Adipurush (primal man) destroyed himself to create a society where the different parts of his body represented the four Varnas. Brahmins came from his head, Kshatriyas came from his hands, Vaishyas came from his thighs, and Sudras came from his feet.
