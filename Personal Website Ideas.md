# Design ideas
Primary Goal: Share information
Goals Level 1:
- Knowledgebase should support backlink views
- Search functionality for notes
Goals Level 2:
- Should show graph of interconnections. Useful for large data.

Organization ideas:
- Zettelkasten + Tags?
- Use folders. Find a balance between nesting folders and atomicity. Use a square model? (64 files = 8 files in 8 folders)
- If we limit to a maximum of 6 folders, 10^6 = 1mi files. Pretty cool.
- Still, need tags, for easy browsing. Say a file is related to multiple folders. Tags are like folders, but folders are for grouping, while tags are for identification. Each note can have a primary tag.
