Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a system in which the user has their own identity, and merely uses the services from a platform using their identity.

This is in contrast to using an identity provider such as Google or Facebook to sign in to multiple services, and use seperate accounts elsewhere. In self-sovereign identity, the user is identified by their own identity instead of an account.

This way, the user can have a persistent online identity without having to rely on identity provider.

This is established most commonly using decentralized technologies.
