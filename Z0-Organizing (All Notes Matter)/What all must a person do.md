When hungry eat, when tired sleep.

To function as a society, if we eat at specific times, we tend to sleep at specific times as well.
To eat, we must obtain food. Food tastes better, and is healthier when cooked.
For cooking food, we must obtain the ingredients.

The ingredients are either manufactured by plants, or taken in by consuming secondary consumers.

Plants can be homegrown or be outsourced. There are public spots like forests as well as privately owned farms. Animals can be homegrown, but we generally do not do it for the sake of consumption. They can also be hunted or be outsourced from other people.

Ingredients are often processed by other people. This could mean the maintenance of the farm itself, or the work performed to convert the raw ingredients to processed ones. For this, we pay the people using currency. Currency is hence a measure of how much a person values their work.

Currency is generally built on the basis of a common understanding within a community. As such, currencies and their values can vary from community to community. For exchange of currency between communities, their valuation can be evaluated by estimating trade volume. To do this, both communities give each other an equal amount of reserve currency, which is exchanged during trades. The valuation of the community currencies can be calculated by taking the ratio of the reserves held by each path.
