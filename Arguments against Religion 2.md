The Lord of Abraham can split seas, but he cannot eradicate what he defines as sin?

If you say it is the work of the devil, well, wasn't that already known by the god too, that the devil could corrupt humans?

If you say that the lord allowed everything to happen, but like a good father, simply told gave them the right path, while still allowing them to choose what they wanted.

But what kind of a father would punish their children for eternity if they refuse to follow his guidance on what was right, if such a deviation from the path would really only affect him? Because all the people who follow the right path is protected by the lord, right?

Secondly, even if there was freedom of choice, a child who stands near a cliff will never desire to jump off the cliff, unless they don't know that they will die by the fall. But if they know they will die, they won't have any particular inclination to jump off the cliff, other than in cases where they value the experience more than life. The thing about death is that, they won't die because someone will judge them when they hit the bottom, simply, death is the result of the forces displacing the body parts.
