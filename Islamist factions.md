- We generally believe that one of the factions, such as Sunni or Shia Muslims could be more extremist than the other. However, that's not true, and it is the dominant culture of the regions that affect how extreme they are.
- Currently the only Shia dominant country is Iran
	- Before the fall of Shah in 1979, Iran was a very secular and modern.
	- Now, it is highly restrictive, with women wearing full black burqas.
- Indonesia is the largest Sunni dominated countries and is less restrictive, with girls wearing just a headscarf
- But Saudi Arabia is the spiritual heart of Sunni Islam, but it is very restrictive
- Morocco is very liberal, and is considered more Western than many of their neighbours.
- Jordan is more traditional than Morocco, but more restrictive than Saudi Arabia.
- UAE is hailed as the most liberal and progressive place in the world.
