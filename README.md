# What is this
This is my personal knowledgebase where I organize information. 

# Why is this
I've always liked to simplify and organize complex information to help explain it to others.

Basically whenever my classmates would talk about how a topic is too complicated, that would motivate me to study it thoroughly and make simpler notes to teach them.

# How is this
Surely, it doesn't have everything, but it can serve as a way for connecting information. I also continuously re-organize the structures so the heirarchies can change.
