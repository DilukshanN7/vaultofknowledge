# What is this
This is my personal knowledgebase where I organize information. 

# Why is this
I've always liked to simplify and organize complex information to help explain it to others. Basically whenever my classmates would talk about how a topic is too complicated, that would motivate me to study it thoroughly and make simpler notes to teach them. I just never stopped doing that.

Over time I figured out that no topic is truly complex, as everything is just an assembly of concepts, that anyone with time and patience can study through.

# How is this
Surely, it doesn't have everything, but it can serve as a way for connecting information. I also continuously re-organize the structures so the heirarchies can change.
