# The Vault of Knowledge

This is my personal knowledgebase where I organize information for future reference. Taking notes in this manner helps reduce entropy in my head, and might also help others.

The title for this site was inspired by a location in the game Sky: Children of The Light with the same name.

Surely, it doesn't have everything, but it can serve as a map for connecting information. I also continuously re-organize the structures so the heirarchies can change.
