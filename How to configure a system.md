Assumptions: Hardware is non modifiable, and software runs on top of hardware which provides the physical interfaces and processing power.


- Step 1: Estimate the requirements to select the hardware.
	- This includes the required processing speed, in operations per second, with the knowledge of the operations in context; the memory required; The persistent memory, or storage required; Any functional interfaces such as radio, wired network, audio sources, audio sinks, peripheral ports, expansion slots, physical size, hardware development road-map and projected compatibility, etc.
- Step 2: Select the appropriate operating system, with a general knowledge of the ecosystem built around it.
	- An operating system defines an abstract and secure way of
